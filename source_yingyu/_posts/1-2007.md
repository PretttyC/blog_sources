By 1830, the former Spanish and Portuguese colonies had become independent nations. The roughly 20 million inhabitants of these nations looked hopefully to the future. Born in the crisis of the old regime and Iberian colonialism, many of the leaders of independence shared the ideals of representative government, careers open to talent, freedom of commerce and trade, the right to private property, and a belief in the individual as the basis of society. Generally there was a belief that the new nations should be sovereign and independent states, large enough to be economically viable and integrated by a common set of laws.

到1830年时，前西班牙和葡萄牙殖民地已变成独立国家。这些国家中的大约2000万居民对未来充满希望。在旧政权和伊比利亚殖民主义的危机中出生，许多独立运动的领导人都有共同的理想，代议制政府、为有才能的人开放就业、商业贸易的自由，私有财产的权利和个体作为社会基础的信仰。一般来说有一个信仰，即是新的国家应该是主权独立的，足够大到经济上能独立生存，且统一于一套通用的法律。

On the issue of freedom of religion and the position of the Church, however , there was less agreement among the leadership. Roman Catholicism had been the state religion and the only one allowed by the Spanish crown. While most leaders sought to maintain Catholicism as the official religion of the new states, some sought to end the exclusion of other faiths. The defense of the Church became a rallying cry for the conservative forces.

但是，在宗教自由和教堂定位的问题上，领导层很少能达成一致。罗马天主教成为国教，且是唯一被西班牙王室授权的宗教。尽管领导者们企图维持天主教为新国家的官方宗教，但是一些领导人试图结束对其它信仰的排斥。对教会的保卫变成了保守力量的战斗口号。

The ideals of the early leaders of independence were often egalitarian, valuing equality of everything.

Egalitarian sentiments were often tempered by fears that the mass of the population was <u>20</u> self-rule and democracy.

The ideals of the early leaders of independence were often egalitarian, valuing equality of everything. Bolivar had received aid from Haiti and had promised in return to abolish slavery in the areas he liberated. By 1854 slavery had been abolished everywhere except Spain’s remaining colonies. Early promises to end Indian tribute and taxes on people of mixed origin came much slower because the new nations still needed the revenue such policies produced. Egalitarian sentiments were often tempered by fears that the mass of the population was unprepared for self-rule and democracy.

早期独立运动的领导者们的理想通常是平等主义、重视一切平等。玻璃瓦接受了来自海地的援助并承诺以在他解放的地区废除奴隶制作为回报。到了1854年，除了西班牙剩余的殖民地，奴隶制已在每个地区被废除。早期对混血民族结束进贡和税务的承诺到来的非常缓慢，是因为新的国家仍然需要这些政策产生的收入。平等主义的情绪通常被对大众没有准备好自治和民主的担忧所缓和。

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006’s World Cup tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy quirk: elite soccer players are more likely to have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the late months. If you then examined the European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and professional ranks, you would find this strange phenomenon to be ever more pronounced.
</summary>
<div class="text">
如果你去检查2006年世界杯锦标赛中的每个足球运动员的出生证明，你将很大可能发现一个值得注意的怪事：精英足球运动员更大可能出生在一年中的早期月份而不是晚些月份。如果你再检查孕育了世界杯和职业队伍的欧洲国家青年队，你将发现这个奇怪的现象越发的明显。
</div>

<summary>
What might account for this strange phenomenon? Here are a few guesses: a) certain astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to have higher oxygen capacity, which increases soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents are more likely to conceive children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania; d) none of the above.
</summary>
<div class="text">
什么可以解释这个奇怪的现象？这有一些猜测：a）某些占星术迹象授予了高级足球技能；b）冬天出生的宝宝往往有更好的氧气能力，这增加了足球运动员的耐力；c）在每年的足球疯迷的巅峰时刻，迷足球的父母更有可能在春天怀上小孩儿；d）以上都不是。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State University, says he believes strongly in “none of the above.” Ericsson grew up in Sweden, and studied nuclear engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to conduct his own research if he switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly 30 years ago, involved memory: training a person to hear and then repeat a random series of numbers. “With the first subject, after about 20 hours of training, his digit span had risen from 7 to 20,” Ericsson recalls. “He kept improving, and after about 200 hours of training he had risen to over 80 numbers.”
</summary>
<div class="text">
58岁的弗洛里达州立大学心理学教授安德斯伊里克森说道，他坚信“以上都不是”。伊里克森在瑞典长大，之前是在研究核工程，直到他意识到如果转到心理学他该有更多的机会从事他自己的研究。将近30年前，他的第一个涉及到记忆的实验：“训练一个人去重复的听一系列随机的数字。在大约20个小时的训练后，对第一个对象，他的数字范围从7个上升到了20个”。伊里克森回忆道：“他继续提升，然后再200个小时的训练后，他提升到了超过80个数字。”
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not genetically determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more of a cognitive exercise than an intuitive one. In other words, whatever inborn differences two people may exhibit in their abilities to memorize, those differences are swamped by how well each person “encodes” the information. And the best way to learn how to encode information meaningfully, Ericsson determined, was a process known as deliberate practice. Deliberate practice entails more than simply repeating a task. Rather, it involves setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.
</summary>
<div class="text">
这个实验的成功，结合之后的研究表明记忆本身不是基因决定的，这让伊里克森作出结论：记忆行为不只是直觉行为，更多的是认知行为。换句话说，无论两个人在记忆能力上呈现出来的有什么区别，那些区别都会被每个人对信息“编码”能力的强弱所掩盖。而伊里克森认为学习如何有意义的编码信息最好的方法是一个名为“有意练习”的过程。“有意练习”需要的不仅仅是简单重复一个任务。更准确的说，它包含设置特定的目标，这个目标能获得立即的反馈且技巧和结果并重。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert performers in a wide range of pursuits, including soccer. They gather all the data they can, not just performance statistics and biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with high achievers. Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait we commonly call talent is highly overrated. Or, put another way, expert performers—whether in memory or surgery, ballet or computer programming—are nearly always made, not born.
</summary>
<div class="text">
伊里克森和他的同事因此开始研究在更多职业中的专家表现者，包括足球。他们收集了他们能收集的所有数据，不仅有职业表现统计数据和生平详细，也有他们自己实验室中对高成就者的实验。他们的工作得出了一个惊人的结论：我们通常称为天赋的特性被过分的高估了。或者换句话说，专家级的表现者不管是在记忆还是外科手术，芭蕾舞还是计算机编程，几乎总是后天养成的而不是天生的。

For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement <i>Parade</i> has featured a column called “Ask Marilyn.” People are invited to query Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had tested at a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228—the highest score ever recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to deduce numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. So it is a bit confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What’s the difference between love and fondness? Or what is the nature of luck and coincidence? It’s not obvious how the capacity to visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits one to answer questions that have eluded some of the best poets and philosophers.

<div class="text">
在过去的几年，星期天日报副刊Parade开设了一个名为“问玛丽莲”的专栏。人们被邀请来询问玛丽莲·沃斯·沙文特，他在10岁测试为23岁人类的智力水平；这个测试给予她228的智商——历史记录中最高分。智商测试要求你完成口头的和视觉的类推，想象纸在折叠和切割后的情况，演绎数字的序列以及其它类似的任务。所以当沃斯·沙文特处理来自于一般的智商只有100的人的提问，如”爱和喜欢有什么区别？或者幸运和巧合的本质是什么？”时有点令人困惑。

Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just what does it mean to be smart? How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we learn about it from neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?
</summary>
<div>
清楚的是，智力包含的不仅仅是测试的分数。到底聪明意味着什么？智力可以被明确说明多少，通过神经学，基因学，计算机科学和其它领域我们能多大程度的了解智力？
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ tests are not given as often as they used to be. The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (both come in adult and children’s version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are usually given only by psychologists, although variations of them populate bookstores and the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like vos Savant’s are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a statistical population distribution among age peers, rather than simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying by 100. Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ tests.
</summary>
<div>
即使智商测试没有像过去那么频繁，人类智力的定义术语仍然看起来像智商分数。测试主要来自于两种形式：斯坦福-比奈特智力测定和温彻斯特智力测定（都有成年人和小孩版本）。一般要花费数百美元，它们通常由心理学家提供，尽管它们的变体通常存在于书店和互联网。像沃斯·沙文特这样超高的分数不再可能了，因为现在评分是基于同龄人中的统计学人口分布，而不是简单地用心理年龄除以实际年龄再乘以100.其它标准测试，如学术评价测试（SAT）和研究生入学考试（GRE），体现了智商测试的主要方面。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements necessary to succeed in school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. In his article “How Intelligent Is Intelligence Testing?”, Sternberg notes that traditional tests best assess analytical and verbal skills but fail to measure creativity and practical knowledge, components also critical to problem solving and life success. Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily predict so well once populations or situations change. Research has found that IQ predicted leadership skills when the tests were given under low-stress conditions, but under high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively correlated with leadership—that is, it predicted the opposite. Anyone who has toiled through SAT will testify that test-taking skill also matters, whether it’s knowing when to guess or what questions to skip.
</summary>
<div>
罗伯特·J·斯坦伯格说道，这样的标准测试可能不能评估出所有的在学校和生活中胜出所必要的重要元素。在他的文章《智力测试有多智能？》中，斯坦伯格表示，传统的测试很好地评估了分析和语言技能，但是测验创造性和实践知识失败了，这部分对于难题的解决和生活上的成功也很关键。此外，一旦人员或者环境发生变化，智商测试不一定能预测的很准。研究发现，当测试处于低压力的情况下，智商预测到了领导才能，但是处于高压力时，智商和领导才能是负相关关系——智商预测出了反面。任何辛苦通过SAT的人证明了应试的能力也很重要，无论是知道什么时候猜测或者忽略什么问题。

During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could count on hard work and fair play to keep itself financially secure has been transformed by economic risk and new realties. Now a pink slip, a bad diagnosis, or a disappearing spouse can reduce a family from solidly middle class to newly poor in a few months.

在上一代人时期，曾经能够依赖努力工作和公平竞争来保证自己经济安全的美国中产家庭已经被经济风险和新的现实改变了。现在一封辞职信，一个坏诊断或者一个消失的配偶都能在几个月内将一个家庭从坚固的中产降为新的穷人。

In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work,transforming basic family economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics of all stripes have debated the social implications of these changes, but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has risen as well. Today’s families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck status. As a result, they have lost the parachute they once had in times of financial setback—a back-up earner (usually Mom) who could go into the workforce if the primary earner got laid off or fell sick. This “added-worker effect” could support the safety net offered by unemployment insurance or disability insurance to help families weather bad times. But today, a disruption to family fortunes can no longer be made up with extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner.

仅仅一代人，数百万的妈妈们开始工作，这改变了基本的家庭经济。学者们、政策制定者们和各种各样的评论家们争辩这些变化的社会含义。但是很少哟人看到副作用：家庭风险也提高了。如今的家庭已经为他们的双薪状态做预算做到了极限。因此，他们已经丢失了他们曾经在金融阻碍时代拥有的降落伞——一个后备挣钱来源（通常是妈妈），如果主要的挣钱来源的变得停滞或者变弱，妈妈可以变成劳动力。这个”附加劳动效应“可以支撑失业保险和残疾保险提供的安全保障来帮组家庭度过困难时期。但是如今，家庭财产的中断不再被来自于另外的呆在家里的成员的额外收入所补充。
</div>

<details>
<summary>
During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more risk in their retirement income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and now those in the auto industry are joining millions of families who must worry about interest rates, stock market fluctuation, and the harsh reality that they may outlive their retirement money. For much of the past year, President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a savings-account model, with retirees trading much or all of their guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns. For younger families, the picture is not any better. Both the absolute cost of healthcare and the share of it borne by families have risen—and newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk for families’ future healthcare. Even demographics are working against the middle class family, as the odds of having a weak elderly parent—and all the attendant need for physical and financial assistance—have jumped eightfold in just one generation.

同时，要求家庭吸收更多的退休收入风险。钢厂工人，飞机雇员和现在那些在自动化产业里的人们正在加入数百万的家庭，这些家庭必须担忧利率、股市起伏和尖锐的现实，即是他们能比他们的退休金活的长。在去年的大部分时间里，布什总统发起了从社会保障到储蓄账户模式转变的运动，也伴随着退休人员将大部分或者全部的保障收入换成了依赖投资回报的收入。对于更年轻的家庭来说，这个情形不会更好。医疗保健的绝对花销和家庭承担的份额都增加了——且新近的风行的健康储蓄计划从立法院扩散到了沃尔玛员工，这对家庭未来的健康保障带来了更高的可扣除额和大量新的投资风险。甚至人口统计数据也对中产家庭不利，因为有老弱的父母的几率——加上所有伴随的体格和经济援助的需要——在仅仅一代人就上升到了8倍。
</div>

<summary>
From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, understandably, looks far less like an opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, and a good deal more like a frightening acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their already overburdened shoulders. The financial fallout has begun, and the political fallout may not be far behind.
</summary>
<div>
从中产家庭的观点看，可以理解的是，这些很多看起来远不像是一个承担更多经济责任的机会，反而更像是大量大规模金融风险向已经不堪负重的肩膀的转移的可怕加速。金融上的影响已经开始，政治上的影响可能已经不远了。

It never rains but it pours. Just as bosses and boards have finally sorted out their worst accounting and compliance troubles, and improved their feeble corporation governance, a new problem threatens to earn them—especially in America—the sort of nasty headlines that inevitably lead to heads rolling in the executive suite: data insecurity. Left, until now, to odd, low-level IT staff to put right, and seen as a concern only of data-rich industries such as banking, telecoms and air travel, information protection is now high on the boss’s agenda in businesses of every variety.
</summary>
<div>
它从不下雨，但它一下就是倾盆大雨（不鸣则已，一鸣惊人）。就在老板们和董事会们最终解决了他们最坏的会计和合规问题，并改善了最弱的公司管理时，一个新的问题开始威胁他们（尤其在美国），一种负面标题不可避免将导致行政人员受罚：即数据安全问题。以前被留给临时的、低级的IT员工来改正的，只被数据富有的产业，如银行业、电信业和航空业关注的信息保护问题，如今已经在各行业的老版的首要日程中。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year—from organizations as diverse as Time Warner, the American defense contractor Science Applications International Corp and even the University of California, Berkeley—have left managers hurriedly peering into their intricate IT systems and business processes in search of potential vulnerabilities.
</summary>
<div>
今年一些顾客和雇员数据的大规模泄漏使管理者们匆忙地查看起他们复杂的IT系统和业务流程以搜寻潜在的漏洞。他们来自于各种各样的组织，如时代华纳，美国国防承包商科学应用国际公私，甚至是加利福利亚大学伯克利分校。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
“Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any other asset,” says Haim Mendelson of Stanford University’s business school. “The ability to guard customer data is the key to market value, which the board is responsible for on behalf of shareholders”. Indeed, just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted Security Practices, suggested Eli Noam of New York’s Columbia Business School. “Setting the proper investment level for security, redundancy, and recovery is a management issue, not a technical one,” he says.
</summary>
<div>
“数据正变成一种资产，它和其它资产一样需要被保护，”斯坦福大学的商学院的哈姆·曼德森说到。“保护顾客数据的能力是市值的关键，董事会代表了股东的利益应该为此负责。”确实，正因为存在一般接受的会计准则（GAAP）的观念，也许实行GASP，即一般接受的安全准则的时候到了，纽约哥伦比亚商学院的伊利·诺姆建议到。“为安全、冗余、恢复设置合适的投资水平是一个管理问题，而不是技术问题”，他说到。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
The mystery is that this should come as a surprise to any boss. Surely it should be obvious to the dimmest executive that trust, that most valuable of economic assets, is easily destroyed and hugely expensive to restore—and that few things are more likely to destroy trust than a company letting sensitive personal data get into the wrong hands.
</summary>
<div>
不可思议的对所有老板来说，这竟然是一个惊喜。确定的是，对于最笨的行政人员都能理解，信任，最有价值的经济资产，最容易被摧毁且恢复非常昂贵——很少有事情有可能摧毁信任，除了一个公司使得敏感的个人数据到了错误的人手中。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
The current state of affairs may have been encouraged—though not justified—by the lack of legal penalty (in America, but not Europe) for data leakage. Until California recently passed a law, American firms did not have to tell anyone, even the victim, when data went astray. That may change fast: lots of proposed data-security legislation is now doing the rounds in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the theft of information about some 40 million credit-card accounts in America, disclosed on June 17th, overshadowed a hugely important decision a day earlier by America’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that puts corporate America on notice that regulators will act if firms fail to provide adequate data security.
</summary>
<div>
尽管这不合理，当前的事态被对数据泄漏的法律惩罚的缺失所助长（在美国，而不是欧洲）。直到加利福利亚最近通过了一项法案，当数据丢失时，美国公司不得不告诉所有人，即使是受害者。这将迅速的改变：在华盛顿许多被提议的数据安全立法正在进行。同时，在6月17号揭露出大约四千万的美国信用账户信息被盗，这使得一天前由美国联邦贸易委员会(FTC)作出的一个重要决定蒙上阴影，该决定通知全体美国企业，如果公司不能提供足够的数据安全，监管将采取行动。

Playing video games encourages immediate content. And hours of watching TV shows with canned laughter only teaches kids to process information in a passive way.

What about the son or daughter who is grown but seems to be struggling and wandering aimlessly through early adulthood? Parents still have a major role to play, but now it is more delicate.

Most of all, these new adults must feel that they are respected and supported by a family that appreciates them.

The study of law has been recognized for centuries as a basic intellectual discipline in European universities.

If the study of law is beginning to establish itself as part and parcel of a general education, its aims and methods should appeal directly to journalism educators. Law is a discipline which encourages responsible judgment. On the one hand, it provides opportunities to analyze such ideas as justice, democracy and freedom. <u class="nospace">(47) On the other, it links these concepts to everyday realities in a manner which is parallel to the links journalists forge on a daily basis as they cover and comment on the news.</u> For example, notions of evidence and fact, of basic rights and public interest are at work in the process of journalistic judgment and production just as in courts of law. Sharpening judgment by absorbing and reflecting on law is a desirable component of a journalist’s intellectual preparation for his or her career.
