Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle viewed laughter as “a bodily exercise precious to health.” But despite some claims to the contrary, laughing probably has little influence on physical fitness. Laughter does produce short-term changes in the function of the heart and its blood vessels, boosting heart rate and oxygen consumption. But because hard laughter is difficult to sustain, a good laugh is unlikely to have measurable benefits the way, say, walking or jogging does.

古代希腊哲学家亚里士多德将笑看作是“一种身体上的对健康有利的运动。”尽管有一些与之相反的观点，但是笑声很可能对身体健康几乎没有影响。笑确实对心脏和它的血管的功能产生了短期的变化，提高了心率和氧气消耗。但是因为大笑是很难维持的，所以一个好的笑是不太可能带来和说话、走路和慢跑一样的明显的好处的。

In fact, instead of straining muscles to build them, as exercise does, laughter apparently accomplishes the opposite. Studies dating back to the 1930s indicate that laughter relaxes muscles, decreasing muscle tone for up to 45 minutes after the laugh dies down.
</div>
<div class="text">
事实上，不像运动那样使肌肉紧张来建立它们，笑明显起到了相反的作用。研究可以追溯到20世纪30年代，研究表明笑可以放松肌肉，且在笑声平息后减少肌肉张力长达45分钟。

Such bodily reaction might conceivably help moderate the effects of psychological stress. Anyway, the act of laughing probably does produce other types of physical feedback that improve an individual’s emotional state. According to one classical theory of emotion, our feelings are partially rooted in physical reactions. It was argued at the end of the 19th century that humans do not cry because they are sad but that they become sad when the tears begin to flow.
</div>
<div class="text">
可以想像，这些身体反应可以帮助舒缓心理压力的影响。不管怎样，笑的行为很可能会产生其它类型的身体反馈，这种反馈可以改善个人的情绪状态。根据一个经典的情绪理论，我们的感情一定程度上来源于身体反应。在19世纪末，有观点认为人类不是因为悲伤而哭，但是当眼泪开始流时它们变得悲伤。

Although sadness also <u>14</u> tears, evidence suggests that emotions can flow <u>15</u> muscular responses. In an experiment published in 1988, social psychologist Fritz Strack of the University of Würzburg in Germany asked volunteers to <u>16</u> a pen either with their teeth – thereby creating an artificial smile – or with their lips, which would produce a(n) <u>17</u> expression. Those forced to exercise their smiling muscles <u>18</u> more enthusiastically to funny cartoons than did those whose mouths were contracted in a frown, <u>19</u> that expressions may influence emotions rather than just the other way around. <u>20</u> , the physical act of laughter could improve mood.

Although sadness also precedes tears, evidence suggests that emotions can flow from muscular responses. In an experiment published in 1988, social psychologist Fritz Strack of the University of Würzburg in Germany asked volunteers to hold a pen either with their teeth – thereby creating an artificial smile – or with their lips, which would produce a(n) disappointed expression. Those forced to exercise their smiling muscles reacted more enthusiastically to funny cartoons than did those whose mouths were contracted in a frown, suggesting that expressions may influence emotions rather than just the other way around. Similarly, the physical act of laughter could improve mood.
</div>
<div class="text">
尽管悲伤也会先于眼泪产生，但是有证据表明情绪能源于肌肉的反应。在1988年发表的一个实验中，德国Würzburg大学的社会心理学家Fritz Strack要求志愿者要么用它们的牙齿咬住一支钢笔(因此建立了一个人工微笑)要么用嘴唇抿住钢笔(这建立了失望的表情)。和那些嘴巴在皱眉中紧闭的人相比，那些被强制练习他们的笑容肌肉的人对有趣的动画有更热情的反应，这表明表情可以影响情绪而不是相反。类似地，笑这一身体的行为能够改善情绪。

<summary>
The decision of the New York Philharmonic to hire Alan Gilbert as its next music director has been the talk of the classical-music world ever since the sudden announcement of his appointment in 2009. For the most part, the response has been favorable, to say the least. “Hooray! At last!” wrote Anthony Tommasini, a sober-sided classical-music critic.
</summary>
<div class="text">
纽约交响乐团雇佣艾伦·吉尔伯特作为它下一任音乐指导的决定自从2009年对这一任命突然的宣称后成为了经典音乐世界的谈资。大部分情况下，至少可以说回应是支持的。“好耶！终于！”，严肃经典音乐评论家艾森尼·托马斯尼写到。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
One of the reasons why the appointment came as such a surprise, however, is that Gilbert is comparatively little known. Even Tommasini, who had advocated Gilbert’s appointment in the <i>Times</i>, calls him “an unpretentious musician with no air of the formidable conductor about him.” As a description of the next music director of an orchestra that has hitherto been led by musicians like Gustav Mahler and Pierre Boulez, that seems likely to have struck at least some <i>Times</i> readers as faint praise.
</summary>
<div class="text">
然而，为什么这个任命是作为一个惊喜到来的原因之一是，吉尔伯特相对来说几乎不被人所知。甚至是托马斯尼，在《时报》中支持对吉尔伯特的任命，也称他是“谦虚的音乐家，没有令人敬畏的指挥家气质”。作为对下一届迄今为止被像Gustav Mahler和Pierre Boulez的音乐家领导的管弦乐队的音乐指挥的描述，这种描述似乎可能至少会让某些《时报》读者觉得是无力的赞美。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
For my part, I have no idea whether Gilbert is a great conductor or even a good one. To be sure, he performs an impressive variety of interesting compositions, but it is not necessary for me to visit Avery Fisher Hall, or anywhere else, to hear interesting orchestral music. All I have to do is to go to my CD shelf, or boot up my computer and download still more recorded music from iTunes.
</summary>
<div class="text">
对我来说
</div>，我不知道吉尔伯特是否是一个伟大的活着好的指挥家。可以确定的是，他表演了令人印象深刻的各种有趣的作品，但是对我来说不是非要去埃弗里·吠舍大厅或其他地方去听有趣的管弦音乐。所有我所需要做的是去我的CD架，活着启动我的电脑并从iTunes下载更多录制好的音乐。
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Devoted concertgoers who reply that recordings are no substitute for live performance are missing the point. For the time, attention, and money of the art-loving public, classical instrumentalists must compete not only with opera houses, dance troupes, theater companies, and museums, but also with the recorded performances of the great classical musicians of the 20th century. These recordings are cheap, available everywhere, and very often much higher in artistic quality than today’s live performances; moreover, they can be “consumed” at a time and place of the listener’s choosing. The widespread availability of such recordings has thus brought about a crisis in the institution of the traditional classical concert.
</summary>
<div class="text">
回应那些记录不是现场表演替代品的忠实音乐会迷们没抓住重点。对于热爱艺术的大众的时间，注意力和金钱而言，古典乐器演奏家们必须不仅要和歌剧院、歌舞团、剧院公司和博物馆竞争，也要和20世纪伟大古典音乐家的录制的表演作品竞争。这些录制品便宜、随处可得，并且通常比今天的现场表演有更高的艺术品质；此外，它们可以被听众在自己选择的时间和地方“消费”。这些录制品广泛的可获得性因此在传统古典音乐会机构中引发了一场危机。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
One possible response is for classical performers to program attractive new music that is not yet available on record. Gilbert’s own interest in new music has been widely noted: Alex Ross, a classical-music critic, has described him as a man who is capable of turning the Philharmonic into “a markedly different, more vibrant organization.” But what will be the nature of that difference? Merely expanding the orchestra’s repertoire will not be enough. If Gilbert and the Philharmonic are to succeed, they must first change the relationship between America’s oldest orchestra and the new audience it hopes to attract.
</summary>
<div class="text">
对于古典表演者一种可能的回应是去制作还不能在录制品上获得的吸引人的新音乐。吉尔伯特本身在新音乐的兴趣被广泛注意到了：古典音乐评论家艾利克斯·罗斯描述他是一个有能力扭转交响乐团进入“显著不同的，更加有活力的组织”的人。但是，那种不同的本质是什么？仅仅扩展管弦乐团的曲目是不够的。如果吉尔伯特和交响乐团成功了，他们必须首先改变美国老派管弦乐团和它们希望吸引的新听众的关系。

When Liam McGee departed as president of Bank of America in August, his explanation was surprisingly straight up. Rather than cloaking his exit in the usual vague excuses, he came right out and said he was leaving “to pursue my goal of running a company.” Broadcasting his ambition was “very much my decision,” McGee says. Within two weeks, he was talking for the first time with the board of Hartford Financial Services Group, which named him CEO and chairman on September 29.

当作为美国银行主席的Liam McGee在8月辞职时，他的解释简单到让人吃惊。不是用通常的含糊借口来隐藏他的退出，他直接出来说道他要离开“去追求我运营一家公司的目标。”传播他的野心“完全是我的决定，”McGee说到。他在两周内首先和Hartford金融服务集团董事会做了交谈,该董事会在9月29日任命他为CEO和主席。

McGee says leaving without a position lined up gave him time to reflect on what kind of company he wanted to run. It also sent a clear message to the outside world about his aspirations. And McGee isn’t alone. In recent weeks the No. 2 executives at Avon and American Express quit with the explanation that they were looking for a CEO post. As boards scrutinize succession plans in response to shareholder pressure, executives who don’t get the nod also may wish to move on. A turbulent business environment also has senior managers cautious of letting vague pronouncements cloud their reputations.

McGee说没有安排好职位的离开给了他时间去思考他想要运营什么类型的公司。这也向外部世界清晰地表明了他的抱负。而McGee并不孤独。最近几周，Avon和美国运通公司的二把手们辞职并解释他们正在寻找CEO职位。随着董事会为了回应股东的压力而仔细审视了继任计划，没有被选中的高管们也希望跳槽。一个动荡的商业环境也使得资深管理人员谨慎于不让含糊的声明使他们的名誉受损。

As the first signs of recovery begin to take hold, deputy chiefs may be more willing to make the jump without a net.

As the economy picks up, opportunities will abound for aspiring leaders.

The decision to quit a senior position to look for a better one is unconventional. For years executives and headhunters have adhered to the rule that the most attractive CEO candidates are the ones who must be poached.

Those who jumped without a job haven’t always landed in top positions quickly. Ellen Marram quit as chief of Tropicana a decade ago, saying she wanted to be a CEO.

He finally took that post at a major financial institution three years later.

Many recruiters say the old disgrace is fading for top performers. The financial crisis has made it more acceptable to be between jobs or to leave a bad one. “The traditional rule was it’s safer to stay where you are, but that’s been fundamentally inverted,” says one headhunter. “The people who’ve been hurt the worst are those who’ve stayed too long.”

The rough guide to marketing success used to be that you got what you paid for. No longer. While traditional “paid” media—such as television commercials and print advertisements – still play a major role, companies today can exploit many alternative forms of media. Consumers passionate about a product may create “earned” media by willingly promoting it to friends, and a company may leverage “owned” media by sending e-mail alerts about products and sales to customers registered with its Web site. The way consumers now approach the process of making purchase decisions means that marketing’s impact stems from a broad range of factors beyond conventional paid media.
</summary>
<div class="text">
营销成功的粗略方针以前是一分钱一分货。现在不再是了。尽管传统的“付费”媒体——比如电视商业广告和平面广告——仍然扮演着主要的角色，但是如今公司可以利用许多可选择形式的媒体。对产品富有热情的消费者可以创造“口碑”媒体，他们乐意推广给他们的朋友们，而公司可以利用“自有”媒体，发送有关产品的提醒邮件和销售信息给在它网站注册的顾客。现在消费者处理做出购买决定的过程的方式意味着营销的影响来自于超过传统付费媒体之外的广泛因素。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Paid and owned media are controlled by marketers promoting their own products. For earned media, such marketers act as the initiator for users’ responses. But in some cases, one marketer’s owned media become another marketer’s paid media – for instance, when an e-commerce retailer sells ad space on its Web site. We define such sold media as owned media whose traffic is so strong that other organizations place their content or e-commerce engines within that environment. This trend, which we believe is still in its infancy, effectively began with retailers and travel providers such as airlines and hotels and will no doubt go further. Johnson & Johnson, for example, has created BabyCenter, a stand-alone media property that promotes complementary and even competitive products. Besides generating income, the presence of other marketers makes the site seem objective, gives companies opportunities to learn valuable information about the appeal of other companies’ marketing, and may help expand user traffic for all companies concerned.
</summary>
<div class="text">
付费媒体和自媒体被推广他们自己产品的营销商所控制。对口碑媒体来说，这些营销商扮演着用户反馈的发起人。但是在某些情况，一个营销商的自媒体会变成另一个营销商的付费媒体——例如，当电子商务零售商在它的网站上出售广告空间时。我们将这种出售媒体定义为自媒体，这种自媒体的流量非常大以至于其他组织将他们的内容或电子商务引擎置于这个环境中。这种趋势，我们相信仍处在初期，实际上开始于零售商和旅游供应商比如航空公司和旅馆，并且毫无疑问会走的更远。例如，强生公司创建了婴儿中心，这是一个独立媒体资产，推广补充性甚至竞争性的产品。除了产生收入，其他营销商的存在使这个网站看起来是客观的，进而给公司机会去了解其他公司吸引力的宝贵信息，进而可以对所有相关的公司去帮助扩大用户流量。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The same dramatic technological changes that have provided marketers with more (and more diverse) communications choices have also increased the risk that passionate consumers will voice their opinions in quicker, more visible, and much more damaging ways.Such hijacked media are the opposite of earned media: an asset or campaign becomes hostage to consumers, other stakeholders, or activists who make negative allegations about a brand or product. Members of social networks, for instance, are learning that they can hijack media to apply pressure on the businesses that originally created them.
</summary>
<div class="text">
同样的重大技术变化，为营销商们提供了更多（更多样化）的沟通选择，但也增加了风险，即热情的消费者们会以更快更明显且更加有伤害性的方式表达他们自己的观点。这些劫持媒体使口碑媒体的对立面：资产或活动变成了对某品牌或产品做消极指控的消费者、其他股东或者激进分子的人质。例如，社交网络的成员正了解到，它们可以劫持媒体来对最开始创造他们的公司施加压力。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
If that happens, passionate consumers would try to persuade others to boycott products, putting the reputation of the target company at risk. In such a case, the company’s response may not be sufficiently quick or thoughtful, and the learning curve has been steep. Toyota Motor, for example, alleviated some of the damage from its recall crisis earlier this year with a relatively quick and well-orchestrated social-media response campaign, which included efforts to engage with consumers directly on sites such as Twitter and the social-news site Digg.
</summary>
<div class="text">
如果那种情况发生了，热情的消费者们会试图说服其他人去抵制产品，使得目标公司的名誉处于风险状态。在这种情况下，公司的回应可能不够快或彻底，而这种学习曲线是陡峭的。比如，Toyota Motor在今年早些时候使用相对快速且精心安排的社交媒体回应活动从它的召回危机中减轻了一些伤害，这个活动包括努力直接和消费者在网站交流，比如Twitter和社会新闻网Digg。

It’s no surprise that Jennifer Senior’s insightful, provocative magazine cover story, “I Love My Children, I Hate My Life,” is arousing much chatter – nothing gets people talking like the suggestion that child rearing is anything less than a completely fulfilling, life-enriching experience. Rather than concluding that children make parents either happy or miserable, Senior suggests we need to redefine happiness: instead of thinking of it as something that can be measured by moment-to-moment joy, we should consider being happy as a past-tense condition. Even though the day-to-day experience of raising kids can be soul-crushingly hard, Senior writes that “the very things that in the moment dampen our moods can later be sources of intense gratification and delight.”
</summary>
<div class="text">
一点都不奇怪，Jennifer Senior的富有见解的，煽动性的杂志封面故事，“我爱我的孩子们，我讨厌我的生活，”引起了很多议论——没有什么事能像这个提议一样引发人们谈论了，即抚养孩子绝不是一个令人完全满意的，丰富生活的体验。Senior不是得出结论：孩子们使得父母要么幸福要么痛苦，他表示我们需要重新定义幸福：不是把它看作可被即时的愉快所衡量的事物，我们应该把幸福看作一种过去的状态。尽管抚养孩子的日常体验可以是击垮灵魂般的艰难，但Senior写到“正是这一刻降低我们情绪的事情可以在之后成为强烈满足感和愉快的源头。”

The magazine cover showing an attractive mother holding a cute baby is hardly the only Madonna-and-child image on newsstands this week. There are also stories about newly adoptive – and newly single – mom Sandra Bullock, as well as the usual “Jennifer Aniston is pregnant” news. Practically every week features at least one celebrity mom, or mom-to-be, smiling on the newsstands.
</summary>
<div class="text">
这个杂志封面展示了一个吸引人的抱着一个可爱宝宝的母亲，这不是这周报摊上唯一的圣母和圣婴画像。也有关于新近收养了孩子的——且新近单身的——妈妈Sandra Bullock的故事，也有通常的““Jennifer Aniston怀孕了”新闻。实际上，每周至少以一个在报摊微笑的名人妈妈或者准妈妈为特别报道。

In a society that so persistently celebrates procreation, is it any wonder that admitting you regret having children is equivalent to admitting you support kitten-killing? It doesn’t seem quite fair, then, to compare the regrets of parents to the regrets of the childless. Unhappy parents rarely are provoked to wonder if they shouldn’t have had kids, but unhappy childless folks are bothered with the message that children are the single most important thing in the world:obviously their misery must be a direct result of the gaping baby-size holes in their lives.
</summary>
<div class="text">
在一个如此执着于歌颂生育的社会中，承认你后悔生孩子就等同于承认你支持虐杀小猫，这又有什么奇怪呢？然后，比较父母的遗憾和无孩子的遗憾似乎并不十分公平。不幸福的父母很少被激发而去怀疑它们是否是不应该有孩子，但是不幸福的无孩子的人们被孩子是世界上唯一最重要的事情这一信息所烦扰：显然他们的痛苦比定是它们生活中张开的宝宝大小的缺口直接造成的。

Of course, the image of parenthood that celebrity magazines like <i>Us Weekly</i> and <i>People</i> present is hugely unrealistic, especially when the parents are single mothers like Bullock. According to several studies concluding that parents are less happy than childless couples, single parents are the least happy of all. No shock there, considering how much work it is to raise a kid without a partner to lean on; yet to hear Sandra and Britney tell it, raising a kid on their “own” (read: with round-the-clock help) is a piece of cake.
</summary>
<div class="text">
当然，像《Us Weekly》和《People》一样的名人杂志所呈现的父母的图像是非常不现实的，尤其是当父母是像Bullock一样的单亲妈妈时。根据一些研究结论，父母没有无孩子的夫妻幸福，单亲父母是所有当中最不幸福的。一点不震惊，想想在没有伴侣可以依靠的情况下，抚养一个孩子需要多少工作；但是，听听Sandra和Britney说的，独立（注：全天候有人帮助）抚养孩子是小菜一碟。

It’s hard to imagine that many people are dumb enough to want children just because Reese and Angelina make it look so glamorous: most adults understand that a baby is not a haircut. But it’s interesting to wonder if the images we see every week of stress-free, happiness-enhancing parenthood aren’t in some small, subconscious way contributing to our own dissatisfactions with the actual experience, in the same way that a small part of us hoped getting “the Rachel” might make us look just a little bit like Jennifer Aniston.

很难想象许多人是足够愚钝到想要孩子仅仅是因为Reese和Angelina使要孩子看起来很有魅力：大多数成年人懂得宝宝不是理发(那样简单)。但是去弄清楚一点是有趣的，即我们每周看到的毫无压力，提升幸福的父母形象是否没有在以某些小的、潜意识的方式促进我们对现实经历的不满，同样的方式，我们中的一小部分人希望剪个“Rachel”发型，这样可能使我们看起来有点像Jennifer Aniston。

<summary>
[A] No disciplines have seized on professionalism with as much enthusiasm as the humanities. You can, Mr Menand points out, become a lawyer in three years and a medical doctor in four. But the regular time it takes to get a doctoral degree in the humanities is nine years. Not surprisingly, up to half of all doctoral students in English drop out before getting their degrees.
</summary>
<div class="text">
[A] 没有哪个学科有人文学科一样的热情去抓住专业化。Menand先生指出，你可以在3年内变成一个律师，在4年内变成一个医学博士。但是获得医学学位在人文学科里所花的通常的时间是9年。不惊讶，英格兰高达一半的英语博士生在获得学位前退学。
</div>
</details>

<summary>
[B] His concern is mainly with the humanities: literature, languages, philosophy and so on. These are disciplines that are going out of style: 22% of American college graduates now major in business compared with only 2% in history and 4% in English. However, many leading American universities want their undergraduates to have a grounding in the basic canon of ideas that every educated person should possess. But most find it difficult to agree on what a “general education” should look like. At Harvard, Mr Menand notes, “the great books are read because they have been read” – they form a sort of social glue.
</summary>
<div class="text">
[B] 他的关注主要是对人文学科：文学、语言、哲学等等。这些是过时的学科：22%的美国大学毕业生现在主修商科，相比之下只有2%在历史和4%在英语。但是，许多顶级美国大学想要他们的本科生有每个受教育人应该拥有的基本思维规则的基础知识。但是大多数人发现对“通识教育”应该是怎样的很难达成一致。Menand先生指出：在哈佛，“伟大的书籍被阅读是由于它们被阅读过”——它们形成了一种社会粘合剂。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
[C] Equally unsurprisingly, only about half end up with professorships for which they entered graduate school. There are simply too few posts. This is partly because universities continue to produce ever more PhDs. But fewer students want to study humanities subjects: English departments awarded more bachelor’s degrees in 1970-71 than they did 20 years later. Fewer students require fewer teachers. So, at the end of a decade of thesis-writing, many humanities students leave the profession to do something for which they have not been trained.
</summary>
<div class="text">
[C] 同样不敢到惊讶，只有大约一半的人最终获得教授职位，为此，他们进入了研究生院。职位实在太少了。这一定程度上是因为大学在持续产生更多的博士。但是只有更少的学生想学人文学科：英语系在1970年到1971年授予了比20年后还多的学士学位。更少的学生需要更少的老师。所以，在10年的论文写作末期，许多人文学科学生离开了他们的专业，去做他们没被训练过的事情。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
[D] One reason why it is hard to design and teach such courses is that they cut across the insistence by top American universities that liberal-arts education and professional education should be kept separate, taught in different schools. Many students experience both varieties. Although more than half of Harvard undergraduates end up in law, medicine or business, future doctors and lawyers must study a non-specialist liberal-arts degree before embarking on a professional qualification.
</summary>
<div class="text">
[D] 为什么设计和教学这些课程很难的一个原因是，他们打破了顶级美国大学的坚持，即文科教育和职业教育应该分开，在不同的学院教学。许多学生都经历了这两种。尽管超过一半的哈佛本科生最终选择了法律、医药或者商科，未来的医生和律师在开始获取专业资格之前必须学习一门非专业的文科学位。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
[E] Besides professionalising the professions by this separation, top American universities have professionalised the professor. The growth in public money for academic research has speeded the process: federal research grants rose fourfold between 1960 and 1990, but faculty teaching hours fell by half as research took its toll. Professionalism has turned the acquisition of a doctoral degree into a prerequisite for a successful academic career: as late as 1969 a third of American professors did not possess one. But the key idea behind professionalisation, argues Mr Menand, is that “the knowledge and skills needed for a particular specialisation are transmissible but not transferable.” So disciplines acquire a monopoly not just over the production of knowledge, but also over the production of the producers of knowledge.
</summary>
<div class="text">
[E] 除了通过这种分离去职业化专业，顶级美国大学已经职业化了教授。公开给学院研究的经费的增长加速了这一过程：联邦研究授权在1960年和1990年之间提升了4倍，但是因为研究的影响教师教学时长下降了一半.职业化使得博士学位的获取变成了学术生涯成功的先决条件：直到1969年三分之一的美国教授还没有拥有一个博士学位。但是Menand表明，职业化背后的关键思想是“特殊专业所需的知识和技能是可传递但不可转让的。”所以学科获得了垄断，不仅是知识地生产，而且是知识生产者的生产。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
[F] The key to reforming higher education, concludes Mr Menand, is to alter the way in which “the producers of knowledge are produced.” Otherwise, academics will continue to think dangerously alike, increasingly detached from the societies which they study, investigate and criticise. “Academic inquiry, at least in some fields, may need to become less exclusionary and more holistic.” Yet quite how that happens, Mr Menand does not say.
</summary>
<div class="text">
[F] Menand先生总结到：改革高等教育的关键是改变“产生知识生产者”的方式。否则，学者们都会继续以危险的方式思考，越来越脱离他们研究、，调查和批判的社会。"至少在某些领域，学术调查可能需要变成更少的排他和更加的整体。”但是那是怎么发生的，Menand先生没有说。

<summary>
[G] The subtle and intelligent little book <i>The Marketplace of Ideas: Reform and Resistance in the American University</i> should be read by every student thinking of applying to take a doctoral degree. They may then decide to go elsewhere. For something curious has been happening in American universities, and Louis Menand, a professor of English at Harvard University, captured it skillfully.

[G] 精妙的，充满智慧的小书《思维的市场：美国大学的改革和阻力》应该被每个思考申请博士学位的学生阅读。然后他们可以决定去别处(另谋出路)。因为一些奇妙的事情一直在美国大学里发生，哈佛大学的英语教授Louis Menand巧妙地捕获到了它。

With its theme that “Mind is the master weaver,” creating our inner character and outer circumstances, the book <i>As a Man Thinketh</i> by James Allen is an in-depth exploration of the central idea of self-help writing.
</summary>
<div class="text">
James Allen所著书籍《作为人的思考》是对自助类作品中心思想的深度探索，本书的主旨是“思维是编织者大师”，它创造了我们的内在品德和外在环境。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<u class="nospace">(46) Allen’s contribution was to take an assumption we all share – that because we are not robots we therefore control our thoughts – and reveal its erroneous nature.</u> Because most of us believe that mind is separate from matter, we think that thoughts can be hidden and made powerless; this allows us to think one way and act another. However, Allen believed that the unconscious mind generates as much action as the conscious mind, and <u class="nospace">(47)while we may be able to sustain the illusion of control through the conscious mind alone, in reality we are continually faced with a question: “Why cannot I make myself do this or achieve that?”</u>
</summary>
<div class="text">
<u class="nospace">(46)Allen的贡献是做出了一个我们公认的假设和揭露它错误的本质——即因为我们不是机器人因此我们可以控制我们自己的思想。</u>因为我们大多相信意识是与物质分开的，所以我们认为思想可以隐藏并变得无力；这允许我们想法是一回事，但行动是另一回事。但是，Allen相信，潜意识产生的行为和表意识一样多，且<u class="nospace">(47)尽管我们可能仅仅通过表意识就可以维持控制意识的错觉，但是现实中我们抑制在面对一个问题：“为什么我不能使自己做或者实现那个？”</u>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Since desire and will are damaged by the presence of thoughts that do not accord with desire, Allen concluded: “We do not attract what we want, but what we are.” Achievement happens because you as a person embody the external achievement; you don’t “get”success but become it. There is no gap between mind and matter.
</summary>
<div class="text">
因为渴望和意愿被不符合渴望的思想的存在所损害，所以Allen总结到：“我们吸引的不是我们想要的，而是我们是什么。”成就的发生是由于你作为一个人而体现的额外成就；你不能“获得”成功而是成为它。物质和意识之间没有缺口。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Part of the fame of Allen’s book is its contention that “Circumstances do not make a person, they reveal him.” <u class="nospace">(48) This seems a justification for neglect of those in need, and a rationalization of exploitation, of the superiority of those at the top and the inferiority of those at the bottom.</u>
</summary>
<div class="text">
Allen的书的部分名声是来自于它的论点，即“环境不会造就人，环境展现人。”<u class="nospace">(48)这似乎是对那些需要帮助的人的的忽视的辩护，和对剥削合理化，上层人士优越性和底层人士卑微性找理由。</u>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
This, however, would be a knee-jerk reaction to a subtle argument. Each set of circumstances, however bad, offers a unique opportunity for growth. If circumstances always determined the life and prospects of people, then humanity would never have progressed. In fact, <u class="nospace">(49) circumstances seem to be designed to bring out the best in us, and if we feel that we have been “wronged” then we are unlikely to begin a conscious effort to escape from our situation.</u> Nevertheless, as any biographer knows, a person’s early life and its conditions are often the greatest gift to an individual.
</summary>
<div class="text">
但是，这将是对这个微妙论点的下意识反应。每一种环境，无论多坏，都为成长提供了独特的机会。如果环境总是能够决定人们的人生和前途，那么人类将永远不会进步。实际上，<u class="nospace">(49)环境似乎被设计成用来引出我们最好的一面，如果我们感觉到我们“错了”，那么我们不太可能有意识地去努力逃出我们的困境。</u>但是，如任何传记作者所知的，一个人的早年人生和它的环境通常是对个人来说最好的礼物。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The sobering aspect of Allen’s book is that we have no one else to blame for our present condition except ourselves. <u class="nospace">(50) The upside is the possibilities contained in knowing that everything is up to us; where before we were experts in the array of limitations, now we become authorities of what is possible.</u>
</summary>
<div class="text">
这本书发人深省的一方面是对于我们现在的处境除了我们自己我们没有其他人可以责备。<u class="nospace">(50)好的一方面是，知道万事都取决于我们，那么就有无限的可能；然而之前我们是熟悉大量局限的专家，如今我们变成了各种可能的权威。</u>
