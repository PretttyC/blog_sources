The ethical judgments of the Supreme Court justices have become an important issue recently. The court cannot maintain its legitimacy as guardian of the rule of law when justices behave like politicians. Yet, in several instances, justices acted in ways that weakened the court’s reputation for being independent and impartial.

<div class="text">
最高法院法官的道德判断最近变成一个重要的问题。当法官像政治家一样行事时，法院不能维持它作为法律规则守卫者的合法性。但是，在一些例子中，法官的行为方式损害了法院独立和公正的声誉。

Justice Antonin Scalia, for example, appeared at political events. That kind of activity makes it less likely that the court’s decisions will be <u>4</u> as impartial judgments. Part of the problem is that the justices are not <u>5</u> by an ethics code. At the very least, the court should make itself <u>6</u> to the code of conduct that <u>7</u> to the rest of the federal judiciary.

Justice Antonin Scalia, for example, appeared at political events. That kind of activity makes it less likely that the court’s decisions will be accepted as impartial judgments. Part of the problem is that the justices are not bound by an ethics code. At the very least, the court should make itself subject to the code of conduct that applies to the rest of the federal judiciary.
</div>
<div class="text">
例如，Antonin Scalia法官出现在政治事件中。那种活动使得法院的决定被人们接受为公正的判断这件事更加不可能。部分问题是法官们不受道德准则约束。至少，法院应该遵守适用于联邦司法系统其他部门的行为准则。

The framers of the Constitution envisioned law as having authority apart from politics.

Our legal system was designed to set law apart from politics precisely because they are so closely tied.
</div>
<div class="text">
宪法的制定者设想法律拥有与政治分开的权威。他们给予大法官们永久的职位，所以他们可以自由地得罪有权利的那些人并且不需要培养政治上的支持。我们的法律体系正好被设计为法律与政治分开，使因为他们联系非常紧密。

Constitutional law is political because it results from choices rooted in fundamental social concepts like liberty and property. When the court deals with social policy decisions, the law it shapes is inescapably political—which is why decisions split along ideological lines are so easily dismissed as unjust.
</div>
<div class="text">
宪法是政治性的，因为它源于根植于基本社会观念的选择，如自由和财产权。当法律处理社会政策的决定时，它所制定的法律不可避免地会政治化——这就是为什么沿着意识形态路线而分裂(在意识形态路线存在分歧)的决定非常容易被认为是不公正的。

<summary>
Come on — Everybody’s doing it. That whispered message, half invitation and half forcing, is what most of us think of when we hear the words <i>peer pressure.</i> It usually leads to no good — drinking, drugs and casual sex. But in her new book <i>Join the Club</i>, Tina Rosenberg contends that peer pressure can also be a positive force through what she calls the social cure, in which organizations and officials use the power of group dynamics to help individuals improve their lives and possibly the world.
</summary>
<div class="text">
来吧——每个人都在做。当我们听到词语同行压力时，那种一半邀请一半强制的低语是我们大多会想到的东西。它通常导致不好的事情——酗酒，吸毒和滥交。但是在新书《加入俱乐部》中，Tina Rosenberg认为通过她所谓的社会治疗同行压力也可以是一股积极的力量，在社会治疗中，组织和官方机构使用群体互动的力量去帮助个体改善他们的人生甚至可能改变世界。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Rosenberg, the recipient of a Pulitzer Prize, offers a host of examples of the social cure in action: In South Carolina, a state-sponsored antismoking program called Rage Against the Haze sets out to make cigarettes uncool. In South Africa, an HIV-prevention initiative known as loveLife recruits young people to promote safe sex among their peers.
</summary>
<div class="text">
Rosenberg，普利策奖的接受者，提供了大量的实践中的社会治疗的例子：在南Carolina州，一个名为反对雾霾的愤怒的政府资助的反吸烟程序开始使吸烟变得不酷。在南非，一个名为珍爱生命的HIV提防倡议招募年轻人去在他们的同辈中推广安全性行为。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The idea seems promising，and Rosenberg is a perceptive observer. Her critique of the lameness of many public-health campaigns is spot-on：they fail to mobilize peer pressure for healthy habits, and they demonstrate a seriously flawed understanding of psychology. “Dare to be different, please don’t smoke!” pleads one billboard campaign aimed at reducing smoking among teenagers — teenagers, who desire nothing more than fitting in. Rosenberg argues convincingly that public-health advocates ought to take a page from advertisers, so skilled at applying peer pressure.
</summary>
<div class="text">
这个理念似乎是有前景的，且Rosenberg是一个有洞察力的观察者。她对许多残废的公共健康运动的批判恰到好处：他们没能调动起同辈的压力来改善健康习惯，并且他们示范了一个严重错误的心理学认识。"敢于不同，请不要吸烟！"一个公告板运动宣传到，目标是减少青少年吸烟——青少年，他们仅仅只是想要融入。Rosenberg令人信服地表示公共健康倡议者应该借鉴擅长于应用同行压力的广告。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
But on the general effectiveness of the social cure, Rosenberg is less persuasive. <i>Join the Club</i> is filled with too much irrelevant detail and not enough exploration of the social and biological factors that make peer pressure so powerful. The most glaring flaw of the social cure as it’s presented here is that it doesn’t work very well for very long. Rage Against the Haze failed once state funding was cut. Evidence that the loveLife program produces lasting changes is limited and mixed.
</summary>
<div class="text">
但是对于社会治疗的通常的效果，Rosenberg欠缺说服力。《加入俱乐部》充满了太多不相关的细节，且对使得同辈压力变得如此强大的社会生物学因素的探索不够。正如它在这(书中)呈现的一样，社会治疗最刺眼的缺陷是它不能太长久地起作用。一旦州资助被切断，反对雾霾的愤怒运动就会失败。证明珍爱生命程序产生了持续改变的证据是有限且有好有坏的。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
There’s no doubt that our peer groups exert enormous influence on our behavior. An emerging body of research shows that positive health habits — as well as negative ones — spread through networks of friends via social communication. This is a subtle form of peer pressure: we unconsciously imitate the behavior we see every day.
</summary>
<div class="text">
毫无疑问，我们的同辈群体对我们的行为实施了极大的影响。不断新出的大量研究表明，积极的健康习惯——消极的习惯也一样——通过朋友网透过社交传播。这是一种同行压力的微妙形式：我们无意识地模仿了我们每天看见的行为。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Far less certain, however, is how successfully experts and bureaucrats can select our peer groups and steer their activities in virtuous directions. It’s like the teacher who breaks up the troublemakers in the back row by pairing them with better-behaved classmates. The tactic never really works. And that’s the problem with a social cure engineered from the outside: in the real world, as in school, we insist on choosing our own friends.
</summary>
<div class="text">
但是，更不确定的是，专家和官员能多成功地挑选我们的同辈群体并在有品德的方向上引导他们的活动。这有点像把后排的麻烦制造者分开的老师，方法是通过将他们和行为更好的同学配对。这个策略从没有真正起过作用。那就是从外部设计的社会治疗的问题：在现实世界中，就像在学校一样，我们坚持选择我们自己的朋友。

A deal is a deal — except, apparently, when Entergy is involved. The company, a major energy supplier in New England, provoked justified outrage in Vermont last week when it announced it was reneging on a longstanding commitment to abide by the strict nuclear regulations.
</summary>
<div class="text">
交易就是交易——显然，除了当Entergy参与时。这个公司，时新英格兰主要的能源供应商，当它宣告它正在违背遵守严格核管制的长期承诺时，在上周的Vermont州激起了合乎情理的愤怒。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Instead, the company has done precisely what it had long promised it would not: challenge the constitutionality of Vermont’s rules in the federal court, as part of a desperate effort to keep its Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant running. It’s a stunning move.
</summary>
<div class="text">
相反，这个公司恰恰做了它长久承诺它不会做的事情：在联邦法院中质疑Vermont州规则的合宪性，这是为了保持它的Vermont Yankee核电厂运行的奋不顾身的努力的一部分。这是一个令人震惊的举措。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The conflict has been surfacing since 2002, when the corporation bought Vermont’s only nuclear power plant, an aging reactor in Vernon. As a condition of receiving state approval for the sale, the company agreed to seek permission from state regulators to operate past 2012. In 2006, the state went a step further, requiring that any extension of the plant’s license be subject to Vermont legislature’s approval. Then, too, the company went along.
</summary>
<div class="text">
这个冲突自2002年后浮现出来，那时该公司买了Vermont的唯一核电厂，Vernon的一个老化的反应堆。作为接受州政府批准出售的条件，该公司同意从州监管者请求2012年以后运营的权限。2006年，该州更进一步要求任何该电厂执照的延期都要服从Vermont立法机构的批准。然后该公司也同意了。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Either Entergy never really intended to live by those commitments, or it simply didn’t foresee what would happen next. A string of accidents, including the partial collapse of a cooling tower in 2007 and the discovery of an underground pipe system leakage, raised serious questions about both Vermont Yankee’s safety and Entergy’s management — especially after the company made misleading statements about the pipe. Enraged by Entergy’s behavior, the Vermont Senate voted 26 to 4 last year against allowing an extension.
</summary>
<div class="text">
要么Entergy绝不会真正想要依赖那些承诺生存，要么是它仅仅没有预见到接下来要发生的事情。一系列意外事故，包括2007年一个冷却塔的部分倒塌和一个地下管道系统泄漏的发现，引发了关于Vermont Yankee的安全和Entergy公司管理的严重质疑——尤其在该公司对管道做出了误导性陈述后。愤怒于Entergy的行为，Vermont议员在去年投出26比4的票来反对允许延期。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Now the company is suddenly claiming that the 2002 agreement is invalid because of the 2006 legislation, and that only the federal government has regulatory power over nuclear issues. The legal issues in the case are obscure: whereas the Supreme Court has ruled that states do have some regulatory authority over nuclear power, legal scholars say that Vermont case will offer a precedent-setting test of how far those powers extend. Certainly, there are valid concerns about the patchwork regulations that could result if every state sets its own rules. But had Entergy kept its word, that debate would be beside the point.
</summary>
<div class="text">
现在该公司突然声称由于2006年的立法2002协议是不合法的，并且只有联邦政府在核问题上有监管权力。该案件中的合法问题是模糊的：虽然最高法院已经裁定各州在核能上的确有一些监管权力，但是法律学者表示，Vermont案将提供一个对那些权利能延伸到多远的开创先例的检验。确定的是，如果每个州都设定它自己的规则，那么是存在对可能导致的补丁规则的合理担忧的。但是如果Entergy遵守了诺言，那么那种争辩就无关紧要了。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The company seems to have concluded that its reputation in Vermont is already so damaged that it has nothing left to lose by going to war with the state. But there should be consequences. Permission to run a nuclear plant is a public trust. Entergy runs 11 other reactors in the United States, including Pilgrim Nuclear station in Plymouth. Pledging to run Pilgrim safely, the company has applied for federal permission to keep it open for another 20 years. But as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reviews the company’s application, it should keep it mind what promises from Entergy are worth.
</summary>
<div class="text">
该公司似乎已经总结出，它在Vermont的名声已经被损害，以至于和州政府开战它也没有什么事情可以失去了。但是应该存在后果。运营核电厂的权限是一个公众信用。Entergy在美国运营了11个另外的反应堆，其中包括Plymouth的朝圣者核电站。在保证要安全地运营朝圣者核电站的同时，该公司已经申请了联邦权限来保持它另外20年是开通的。但是核监管委员会审查了该公司的申请，应该要注意到Entergy的什么承诺是有价值的。

<summary>
In the idealized version of how science is done, facts about the world are waiting to be observed and collected by objective researchers who use the scientific method to carry out their work. But in the everyday practice of science, discovery frequently follows an ambiguous and complicated route. We aim to be objective, but we cannot escape the context of our unique life experiences. Prior knowledge and interests influence what we experience, what we think our experiences mean, and the subsequent actions we take. Opportunities for misinterpretation, error, and self-deception abound.
</summary>
<div class="text">
在科学是如何做的理想化版本的说法中，关于世界的事实正等待被客观的研究者观察和收集，他们使用科学的方法去执行工作。但是在科学的每天实践中，发现频繁的遵守着一个模糊且复杂的路线。我们的目的是客观，但是我们不能避免我们唯一的生活经验环境。之前的知识和兴趣影响着我们的经历、我们所认为我们的经验的意义和随后我们采取的行动。误解的机会、错误和自我欺骗大量存在。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Consequently, discovery claims should be thought of as protoscience. Similar to newly staked mining claims, they are full of potential. But it takes collective scrutiny and acceptance to transform a discovery claim into a mature discovery. This is the credibility process, through which the individual researcher’s me, here, now becomes the community’s anyone, anywhere, anytime. Objective knowledge is the goal, not the starting point.
</summary>
<div class="text">
因此，发现声明应该被看作是原始科学。类似于新近划定的采矿声明，他们充满了可能性。但是将发现声明转变为成熟的发现需要集体的审查和接受。这就是可信度过程，通过这个过程，个体研究的我，此地，此时，现在变成了社区的任何人，任何地方，任何时间。客观的知识是目的，而不是起点。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Once a discovery claim becomes public, the discoverer receives intellectual credit. But, unlike with mining claims, the community takes control of what happens next. Within the complex social structure of the scientific community, researchers make discoveries; editors and reviewers act as gatekeepers by controlling the publication process; other scientists use the new finding to suit their own purposes; and finally, the public (including other scientists) receives the new discovery and possibly accompanying technology. As a discovery claim works its way through the community, the interaction and confrontation between shared and competing beliefs about the science and the technology involved transforms an individual’s discovery claim into the community’s credible discovery.
</summary>
<div class="text">
一旦一个发现声明变得公开，发现者将接受学术上的赞扬。但是，不像采矿业声明，社区会控制接下来所发生的事情。在科学界复杂的社会结构中，研究院做出发现；编辑人员和审查人员扮演控制发布过程的看门人角色；其他科学家使用这个新发现去满足他们自己的目的；最后，公众（包括其他科学家）接受了这个新发现和可能伴随的技术。随着一个发现声明通过科学界努力达成目标，在关于涉及到的科技的分享信念和竞争信念之间的互动和对抗将个体的发现声明转变成了科学界的可信发现。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Two paradoxes exist throughout this credibility process. First, scientific work tends to focus on some aspect of prevailing knowledge that is viewed as incomplete or incorrect. Little reward accompanies duplication and confirmation of what is already known and believed. The goal is <i>new-search</i>, not <i>re-search</i>. Not surprisingly, newly published discovery claims and credible discoveries that appear to be important and convincing will always be open to challenge and potential modification or refutation by future researchers. Second, novelty itself frequently provokes disbelief. Nobel Laureate and physiologist Albert Szent-Györgyi once described discovery as “seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought.” But thinking what nobody else has thought and telling others what they have missed may not change their views. Sometimes years are required for truly novel discovery claims to be accepted and appreciated.
</summary>
<div class="text">
两个悖论存在于整个可信过程中。首先，科学工作往往聚焦于一些流行的知识方面，这些知识被看作是不完整或不正确的。很少的奖励伴随着对已知的和已相信的事物的重复和证实（对已知的和已相信的事物的重复和证实几乎没有奖励）。目标是新探索，而不是再探索。不令人惊讶的是，新近发布的似乎重要且令人信服的发现声明和可信发现将总是开放质疑和可能的修正或者被未来的研究者反驳。其次，新奇的事物本身就经常地引起怀疑。诺贝尔奖获得者，生理学家Albert Szent-Györgyi曾今将发现描述为“看见没人都见过的和思考没有人思考过的。”但是思考没有其他人思考过的和告诉他人他们所错过的可能不会改变他们的观点。对于真正新奇的发现声明，有时候需要很多年才被接受和理解。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
In the end, credibility “happens” to a discovery claim — a process that corresponds to what philosopher Annette Baier has described as the commons of the mind. “We reason together, challenge, revise, and complete each other’s reasoning and each other’s conceptions of reason.”
</summary>
<div class="text">
最后，可信“发生”在发现声明中——这个过程符合哲学家Annette Baier描述的思维的共性。“我们一起推论、质疑、修订并完善互相的推理和互相对理性的理解。”

If the trade unionist Jimmy Hoffa were alive today, he would probably represent civil servants. When Hoffa’s Teamsters were in their prime in 1960, only one in ten American government workers belonged to a union; now 36% do. In 2009 the number of unionists in America’s public sector passed that of their fellow members in the private sector. In Britain, more than half of public-sector workers but only about 15% of private-sector ones are unionized.

There are three reasons for the public-sector unions’ thriving. First, they can shut things down without suffering much in the way of consequences. Second, they are mostly bright and well-educated. A quarter of America’s public-sector workers have a university degree. Third, they now dominate left-of-centre politics. Some of their ties go back a long way. Britain’s Labor Party, as its name implies, has long been associated with trade unionism. Its current leader, Ed Miliband, owes his position to votes from public-sector unions.

In many rich countries average wages in the state sector are higher than in the private one. But the real gains come in benefits and work practices.

Reform has been vigorously opposed, perhaps most egregiously in education, where charter schools, academies and merit pay all faced drawn-out battles.

John Donahue at Harvard’s Kennedy School points out that the norms of culture in Western civil services suit those who want to stay put but is bad for high achievers. The only American public-sector workers who earn well above $250,000 a year are university sports coaches and the president of the United States. Bankers’ fat pay packets have attracted much criticism, but a public-sector system that does not reward high achievers may be a much bigger problem for America.
