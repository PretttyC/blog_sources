1924年美国国家研究委员会派两名工程师去一个在芝加哥附近叫做霍松尔工厂的大型电话零件厂指导一系列的工业实验。委员会希望他们了解车间的照明是如何影响工人的生产力的。但是，这些研究最终命名“霍松儿效应”，这一极度有影响力的理念即是，正是被用来做实验的行为改变了实验对象的行为。
</div>

<summary>
The idea arose because of the <u>4</u> behavior of the women in the Hawthorne plant. According to <u>5</u> of the experiments, their hourly output rose when lighting was increased, but also when it was dimmed. It did not <u>6</u> what was done in the experiment; <u>7</u> something was changed, productivity rose.

</summary>
<div class="text">
The idea arose because of the perplexing behavior of the women in the Hawthorne plant. According to accounts of the experiments, their hourly output rose when lighting was increased, but also when it was dimmed. It did not matter what was done in the experiment;so long as something was changed, productivity rose. An awarenes that they were being experimented upon seemed to be enough to alter workers' behavior by itself.
</div>
<div class="text">
这个观点的出现是来源于霍松儿工厂的女性们的令人困惑的行为。根据对实验的解释，他们每小时的产出在照明增加时上升，也在照明昏暗时上升。实验中做了什么并不要紧；只要某件事发生了变化，生产率就会提升。意识到他们被用做实验似乎就足够单独改变工人们的行为。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
After several decades, the same data were <u>11</u> to econometric analysis. The Hawthorne experiments has another surprise in store. <u>12</u> the descriptions on record, no systematic <u>13</u> was found that levels of productivity were related to changes in lighting.

<div class="text">
After several decades, the same data were subjected to econometric analysis. The Hawthorne experiments has another surprise in store. Contrary to the descriptions on record, no systematic evidence was found that levels of productivity were related to changes in lighting.
</div>
<div class="text">
几十年后，同样的数据遭受了计量经济学分析。霍松儿实验有了另一个令人惊讶的发现。与记录中的描述相反的是，没有系统的证据证明生产力的水平与照明的变化有关。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
It turns out that peculiar way of conducting the experiments may be have led to <u>14</u> interpretation of what happened. <u>15</u>, lighting was always changed on a Sunday. When work started again on Monday, output <u>16</u> rose compared with the previous Saturday and <u>17</u> to rise for the next couple of days. <u>18</u>, a comparison with data for weeks when there was no experimentation showed that output always went up on Monday, Workers <u>19</u> to be diligent for the first few days of the week in any case, before <u>20</u> a plateau and then slackening off. This suggests that the alleged "Hawthorne effect" is hard to pin down.
</summary>
<div class="text">
It turns out that peculiar way of conducting the experiments may be have led to misleading interpretation of what happened. For example, lighting was always changed on a Sunday. When work started again on Monday, output duly rose compared with the previous Saturday and continued to rise for the next couple of days. However, a comparison with data for weeks when there was no experimentation showed that output always went up on Monday, Workers tended to be diligent for the first few days of the week in any case, before hitting a plateau and then slackening off. This suggests that the alleged "Hawthorne effect" is hard to pin down.
</div>
<div class="text">
结果是，进行实验的奇特方式可能导致了对所发生事情的误导解释。比如，照明在周日总是发生改变。当工作在周一再次开始时，和上周六相比，产出如期地上升了，并且在接下俩的几天里继续上升。但是，与没有进行实验的几周数据进行对比，结果是产出总是在周一上升，任何情况下，在达到稳定期之前，工人们在一周的前几天往往很勤奋，之后放松下来。这表明所谓的“霍松儿效应”很难确切地解释的。

Of all the changes that have taken place in English-language newspapers during the past quarter-century, perhaps the most far-reaching has been the inexorable decline in the scope and seriousness of their arts coverage. 
</summary>
<div class="text">
在所有的发生在过去四分之一世纪的英语报纸的变化中，也许最影响深远的是他们的艺术报道在范围和严肃性方面不可阻挡地减少。

<summary>
It is difficult to the point of impossibility for the average reader under the age of forty to imagine a time when high-quality arts criticism could be found in most big-city newspapers. Yet a considerable number of the most significant collections of criticism published in the 20th century consisted in large part of newspaper reviews. To read such books today is to marvel at the fact that their learned contents were once deemed suitable for publication in general-circulation dailies.
</summary>
<div class="text">
对于40岁以下的一般读者，难以想象到了不可能的程度，有一个时代，高质量的艺术评论可以在大多数大城市的报纸里找到。但是相当数量的最有意义的发表于20世纪的评论集来自于大部分报纸评论。如今读这些书籍会惊讶于这样的事实：它们博学的内容曾经被认为适合于发表在大众发行的日报中。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
We are even farther removed from the unfocused newspaper reviews published in England between the turn of the 20th century and the eve of World War II, at a time when newsprint was dirt-cheap and stylish arts criticism was considered an ornament to the publications in which it appeared. In those far-off days, it was taken for granted that the critics of major papers would write in detail and at length about the events they covered. Theirs was a serious business, and even those reviewers who wore their learning lightly, like George Bernard Shaw and Ernest Newman, could be trusted to know what they were about. These men believed in journalism as a calling, and were proud to be published in the daily press. “So few authors have brains enough or literary gift enough to keep their own end up in journalism,” Newman wrote, “that I am tempted to define ‘journalism’ as ‘a term of contempt applied by writers who are not read to writers who are.’”
</summary>
<div class="text">
我们甚至远离了在20世纪初到二战前夕期间发表子啊英格兰的不专注的报纸评论，在那时，新闻用纸非常便宜，时髦的艺术评论被看作它所在的出版物的装饰。在那些遥远的日子里，被认为理所当然的是，关于他们报道的事件，主要文章的评论会被详细充分地写出。他们的工作是严肃的事情，即使是那些轻松展示他们学问的评论者，如乔治·萧伯纳（George Bernard Shaw）和欧内斯特·纽曼（Ernest Newman），也可以被相信他们了解他们所做的事情。这些人信奉新闻业作为一种使命，并且自豪于在每日新闻上发表。“所以只有很少的作者们有足够的头脑或者足够的文学天赋来使得他们保持在新闻业结束职业生涯”，Newman写到，“以至于我想定义‘新闻业’为‘被没有读者的作者适用到有读者作者的鄙视性术语。’”
</div>

<summary>
Unfortunately, these critics are virtually forgotten. Neville Cardus, who wrote for the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> from 1917 until shortly before his death in 1975, is now known solely as a writer of essays on the game of cricket. During his lifetime, though, he was also one of England’s foremost classical-music critics, a stylist so widely admired that his <i>Autobiography</i>(1947) became a best-seller. He was knighted in 1967, the first music critic to be so honored. Yet only one of his books is now in print, and his vast body of writings on music is unknown save to specialists.
</summary>
<div class="text">
不幸的是，这些评论家几乎已经被忘记了。Neville Cardus，从1917年一直到他在1975年死去的不久前都在为《曼彻斯特卫报》写作，现在仅仅仅仅是作为板球游戏相关的文章作者而被人所知。尽管，在他的一生中，他也是英格兰最重要的经典英语评论家之一，也是被广泛赞赏的设计师，以至于他的《自传》(1947)成为了畅销书。他在1967年被封爵，首个被授予如此荣耀的音乐评论家。但是如今只有一本他的书出版，他的大量关于音乐的作品除了专家未被人所知。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Is there any chance that Cardus’s criticism will enjoy a revival? The prospect seems remote. Journalistic tastes had changed long before his death, and postmodern readers have little use for the richly upholstered Vicwardian prose in which he specialized. Moreover, the amateur tradition in music criticism has been in headlong retreat.
</summary>
<div class="text">
Cardus的评论还有机会复兴吗？前景似乎很遥远。记者的品味早在他死前就发生了变化，而后现代的读者几乎不需要他擅长的具有丰富辞藻的Vicwardian风格的散文。此外，音乐评论中的业余爱好者传统也在急速衰退中。

Now the nation's top patent court appears completely ready to scale back on business-method patents, which have been controversial ever since they were first authorized 10 years ago. In a move that has intellectual-property lawyers abuzz the U.S. court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said it would use a particular case to conduct a broad review of business-method patents. <i>In re Bilski</i>, as the case is known , is "a very big deal", says Dennis D. Crouch of the University of Missouri School of law. It "has the potential to eliminate an entire class of patents."

现在国家顶级专利法院似乎完全准备好去缩减商业方法专利了，自从这些专利10年前第一次被授权以来就一直饱受争议。在一个使得知识产权律师们议论纷纷的举措中，美国联邦巡回上诉法院表示它将使用一个特殊的案例来实施对商业方法专利的广泛审查。In re Bilski作为广为人知的案例，是大事，Missouri大学法学院的Dennis D. Crouch说到。它“有潜能去完全消除一类专利。”

Curbs on business-method claims would be a dramatic about-face, because it was the federal circuit itself that introduced such patents with its 1998 decision in the so-called State Street Bank case, approving a patent on a way of pooling mutual-fund assets. That ruling produced an explosion in business-method patent filings, initially by emerging internet companies trying to stake out exclusive rights to specific types of online transactions. Later, more established companies raced to add such patents to their files, if only as a defensive move against rivals that might beat them to the punch. In 2005, IBM noted in a court filing that it had been issued more than 300 business-method patents despite the fact that it questioned the legal basis for granting them. Similarly, some Wall Street investment firms armed themselves with patents for financial products, even as they took positions in court cases opposing the practice.

对商业方法申请的抑制将是戏剧性的转变，因为正是联邦巡回法院它自己在1998年对所谓的State Street银行案做出决定引进了这些专利，这个决定批准了一个关于收集互助基金资产方法的专利。那个裁定在商业方法专利申请方面产生了激增，起初是新兴的互联网公司试图对特定类型的在线交易表明占有权。之后，更多的老牌公司竞争去增加这些专利到它们的文件中，只要是作为对抗可能抢先一步的竞争对手的防御性措施就好。在2005年，IBM在一个法院归档文件中表明它已经发布了超过300个商业方法专利，尽管它质疑给这些专利授权的合法基础。类似的，一些华尔街投资公司用金融产品专利来武装自己，即使它们在法院案例中采取反对这种做法的态度。

The Bilski case involves a claimed patent on a method for hedging risk in the energy market.

The Federal Circuit's action comes in the wake of a series of recent decisions by the supreme Court that has narrowed the scope of protections for patent holders. Last April, for example the justices signaled that too many patents were being upheld for "inventions" that are obvious.

In his book <i>The Tipping Point</i>, Malcolm Gladwell argues that “social epidemics” are driven in large part by the acting of a tiny minority of special individuals, often called influentials, who are unusually informed, persuasive, or well-connected. The idea is intuitively compelling, but it doesn't explain how ideas actually spread.
</summary>
<div class="text">
Malcolm Gladwell在他的书《转折点》中表明，“社会潮流”很大程度是由极少数的特殊个体们的行为驱动的，这些人通常称为有影响人士，他们通常见多识广，能言善辩或者有好的人际关系。这种观点直觉上是令人信服的，但是它不能解释想法实际上是如何传播的。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The supposed importance of influentials derives from a plausible-sounding but largely untested theory called the "two-step flow of communication": Information flows from the media to the influentials and from them to everyone else. Marketers have embraced the two-step flow because it suggests that if they can just find and influence the influentials, those selected people will do most of the work for them. The theory also seems to explain the sudden and unexpected popularity of certain looks, brands, or neighborhoods. In many such cases, a cursory search for causes finds that some small group of people was wearing, promoting, or developing whatever it is before anyone else paid attention. Anecdotal evidence of this kind fits nicely with the idea that only certain special people can drive trends.
</summary>
<div class="text">
所谓的有影响人士的重要性起源于一个听起来似乎合理但大部分未被证实的理论，其名为“两步流交流”：信息从媒体流入有影响力人士，然后从他们流入其他每个人。市场营销人员拥抱了这个两步流理论，因为它表明如果他们能够找到并影响有影响力人士，那么那些被选中的人们将为他们完成大部分工作。这个理论似乎也解释了突然的意料之外的某个样式、品牌或地区的流行。在许多这样的案例中，对原因粗略的调查发现，在任何其他人注意到之前就有一些小群体的人就在穿戴、推广或者开发各种东西。这种奇闻逸事的证据很好地符合了这种观点：只有某些特定的人能够驱动潮流。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
In their recent work, however, some researchers have come up with the finding that influentials have far less impact on social epidemics than is generally supposed. In fact, they don't seem to be required of all.
</summary>
<div class="text">
但是，一些研究人员在他们最近的工作中提出，有影响力人士对社会流行产生的影响远比普遍假设的小。实际上，似乎根本不需要他们。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The researchers' argument stems from a simple observing about social influence: With the exception of a few celebrities like Oprah Winfrey—whose outsize presence is primarily a function of media, not interpersonal, influence—even the most influential members of a population simply don't interact with that many others. Yet it is precisely these non-celebrity influentials who, according to the two-step-flow theory, are supposed to drive social epidemics, by influencing their friends and colleagues directly. For a social epidemic to occur, however, each person so affected, must then influence his or her own acquaintances, who must in turn influence theirs, and so on; and just how many others pay attention to each of these people has little to do with the initial influential. If people in the network just two degrees removed from the initial influential prove resistant, for example, the cascade of change won't propagate very far or affect many people.
</summary>
<div class="text">
这些研究人员的观点来源于一个简单的关于社会潮流的观察：除了一些名人之外，比如Oprah Winfrey（他极大的存在感主要是媒体影响而不是人际影响的作用），即使是人群中最有影响力的人员也不和许多其他人交往。但是根据两步流理论，正是这些非著名的有影响力人士应该通过直接影响他们的朋友和同事去驱动社会潮流。但是，对于要出现的社会潮流，每个受影响的人，之后必会影响他或她认识的人，这些人也必定会反过来影响他们认识的人，如此等等；而有多少其他人注意到这些人的每一个与最初的有影响力人士几乎没有关系。例如，如果网络中远离最初有影响力人士有两个层级的人们被证明是抵抗的，那么一连串的改变将不会传播很远或影响许多人。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Building on the basic truth about interpersonal influence, the researchers studied the dynamics of social influence by conducting thousands of computer simulations of populations, manipulating a number of variables relating to people’s ability to influence others and their tendency to be influenced. They found that the principal requirement for what is called “global cascades”—the widespread propagation of influence through networks—is the presence not of a few influentials but, rather, of a critical mass of easily influenced people.
</summary>
<div class="text">
基于人际影响的基本事实，研究员研究了社会影响的动态过程，方法是运行数以千计的人群计算机模拟，和处理大量的与人们影响他人的能力和被影响倾向相关变量。他们发现所谓的“全球串联”（通过网络进行的广泛传播）的主要要求不是一些有影响力人士的存在，而是大量关键的容易受影响的人的存在。

<summary>
Bankers have been blaming themselves for their troubles in public. Behind the scenes, they have been taking aim at someone else: the accounting standard-setters. Their rules, moan the banks, have forced them to report enormous losses, and it's just not fair. These rules say they must value some assets at the price a third party would pay, not the price managers and regulators would like them to fetch.
</summary>
<div class="text">
在公开场合，银行家们一直在将麻烦归咎于他们自己。在这些场景背后，他们一直瞄准着其他人：会计标准制定者。各家银行都抱怨他们的规则强迫他们报告巨额损失，而这不公平。这些规则表示他们必须以第三方会支付的价格来评估这些资产，而不是以管理者和监管想要他们卖得的价格。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Unfortunately, banks' lobbying now seems to be working. The details may be unknowable, but the independence of standard-setters, essential to the proper functioning of capital markets, is being compromised. And, unless banks carry toxic assets at prices that attract buyers, reviving the banking system will be difficult.
</summary>
<div class="text">
不幸的是，银行的游说如今似乎起作用了。细节可能不可知，但是标准制定者的独立性（对于资本市场的正当作用是必要的）正在被损害。而且，除非银行出售以能吸引买家的价格出售有毒资产，否则恢复银行体系将很困难。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
After a bruising encounter with Congress, America's Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rushed through rule changes. These gave banks more freedom to use models to value illiquid assets and more flexibility in recognizing losses on long-term assets in their income statement. Bob Herz, the FASB's chairman, cried out against those who "question our motives." Yet bank shares rose and the changes enhance what one lobby group politely calls "the use of judgment by management."
</summary>
<div class="text">
在一场与国会激烈的交锋后，美国财政会计标准委员会(FASB)匆忙通过了规则的修改。这给了银行更多的自由去使用模型来评估非流动性资产，在识别收益报表中长期资产的亏损有了更多的灵活性。FASB的主席Bob Herz大声地反对那些“质疑我们动机”的人。但是银行股上升了，且修改加强了一个游说群体礼貌性称为的“管理层判断力的使用。”
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
European ministers instantly demanded that the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) do likewise. The IASB says it does not want to act without overall planning, but the pressure to fold when it completes its reconstruction of rules later this year is strong. Charlie McCreevy, a European commissioner, warned the IASB that it did "not live in a political vacuum" but "in the real word" and that Europe could yet develop different rules.
</summary>
<div class="text">
欧洲部长们立即要求国际会计标准委员会（IASB）也这样做。IASB声称它不想在没有完全的计划的情况下做出行动，但是在今年晚些时候它完成规则的重建时，所收到屈服的压力是很大的。欧洲委员Charlie McCreevy警告IASB，它“不能活在政治真空中”，而“要活在真实的世界”，而欧洲还可以开发不同的规则。
</div>

<details>
<summary>
It was banks that were on the wrong planet, with accounts that vastly overvalued assets. Today they argue that market prices overstate losses, because they largely reflect the temporary illiquidity of markets, not the likely extent of bad debts. The truth will not be known for years. But bank's shares trade below their book value, suggesting that investors are skeptical. And dead markets partly reflect the paralysis of banks which will not sell assets for fear of booking losses, yet are reluctant to buy all those supposed bargains.
</summary>
<div class="text">
是银行不切实际，账目过度高估资产。现在他们认为市值夸大了亏损，因为他们主要反映了市场的临时非流动性，而不是坏债的可能程度。这个真相将在很多年不被人所知（真相在多年后才能知晓）。但是银行股票以低于帐面价值来交易，这表明投资者是持怀疑态度的。而没有生气的市场一定程度上反映出银行的瘫痪，银行不会出售资产以免出现帐面亏损，但是又不情愿购买那些所谓的便宜货。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
To get the system working again, losses must be recognized and dealt with. America's new plan to buy up toxic assets will not work unless banks mark assets to levels which buyers find attractive. Successful markets require independent and even combative standard-setters. The FASB and IASB have been exactly that, cleaning up rules on stock options and pensions, for example, against hostility from special interests. But by giving in to critics now they are inviting pressure to make more concessions.
</summary>
<div class="text">
要使系统再次运作起来，亏损必须被识别出来并处理。美国买下所有有毒资产的新计划将不起作用，除非银行将资产标记为购买者认为有吸引力的水平。成功的市场需要独立甚至好战的标准制定者。FASB和IASB一直就是那样的，例如整顿股票期权和养老金的规则，对抗来自特殊利益集团的敌意。但是通过让步于批评家，如今他们正招致做出更多让步的压力。

<br />

<details>
<summary>
[A] The first and more important is the consumer's growing preference for eating out; the consumption of food and drink in places other than homes has risen from about 32 percent of total consumption in 1995 to 35 percent in 2000 and is expected to approach 38 percent by 2005. This development is boosting wholesale demand from the food service segment by 4 to 5 percent a year across Europe, compared with growth in retail demand of 1 to 2 percent. Meanwhile, as the recession is looming large, people are getting anxious. They tend to keep a tighter hold on their purse and consider eating at home a realistic alternative.
</summary>
<div class="text">
[A] 首先也最重要的是消费者增长的出去吃的偏好。在除了家里之外的地方对食物和饮料的消耗从1995总消耗的32%上升到2000年的35%，且预期会在2005年接近于38%。这种发展正提高来自食品服务市场的批发需求，和1%到2%的零售需求增长相比，整个欧洲一年提升4%到5%。同时，随着衰退越来越严重，人们变得焦虑起来。他们倾向于捂紧自己的钱包并考虑在家吃饭这一现实的选择。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
[B] Retail sales of food and drink in Europe's largest markets are at a standstill, leaving European grocery retailers hungry for opportunities to grow. Most leading retailers have already tried e-commerce, with limited success, and expansion abroad. But almost all have ignored the big, profitable opportunity in their own backyard: the wholesale food and drink trade, which appears to be just the kind of market retailers need.
</summary>
<div class="text">
[B] 欧洲最大市场中的食物和饮料的零售处于停顿状态，这使得欧洲杂货铺零售商渴望找到增长的机会。大多领头的零售商已经尝试了电子商务，效果有限，同时也尝试了海外扩张。但是几乎所有的人都忽视了一个在他们自己后院的大且有收益的机会：食品和饮料批发交易，这似乎正好市场零售商需要的类型。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
[C] Will such variations bring about a change in the overall structure of the food and drink market? Definitely not. The functioning of the market is based on flexible trends dominated by potential buyers. In other words, it is up to the buyer, rather than the seller, to decide what to buy. At any rate, this change will ultimately be acclaimed by an ever-growing number of both domestic and international consumers, regardless of how long the current consumer pattern will take hold.
</summary>
<div class="text">
[C] 这些变化将导致在食物和饮料市场总体结构的改变吗？当然不会。市场的运转时是基于受潜在买家主导的灵活趋势。换句话说，它取决于买家，而不是卖家，去决定买什么。无论如何，不管当前的消费者模式将持续多久，这些改变将最终被一直增长的国内外的消费者们所赞同。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
[D] All in all, this clearly seems to be a market in which big retailers could profitably apply their scale, existing infrastructure and proven skills in the management of product ranges, logistics, and marketing intelligence. Retailers that master the intricacies of wholesaling in Europe may well expect to rake in substantial profits thereby. At least, that is how it looks as a whole. Closer inspection reveals important differences among the biggest national markets, especially in their customer segments and wholesale structures, as well as the competitive dynamics of individual food and drink categories. Big retailers must understand these differences before they can identify the segments of European wholesaling in which their particular abilities might unseat smaller but entrenched competitors. New skills and unfamiliar business models are needed too.
</summary>
<div class="text">
[D] 总而言之，这似乎明显是一个大零售商可以运用它们的规模、现存基础设施和被验证过的在管理产品领域、物流和市场情报方面的技能来获利的市场。掌握了欧洲批发市场的错综复杂情况的零售商很可能因此期望能轻易赚取大量的收益。至少，那就是它作为一个整体被如何看待的（总体上看是如此）。更进一步的审查揭露了在最大国家市场间的区别，尤其是它们的客户细分和批发结构，单个的食品和饮料类别的竞争动态也是如此。大型零售商必须了解这些差异，然后才能确定欧洲批发的细分市场，在这些细分市场中，它们的特殊能力可以使小但根深蒂固的竞争者失去资格。还需要新的技能和不常见的商业模式。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
[E] Despite variations in detail, wholesale markets in the countries that have been closely examined—France, Germany, Italy, and Spain—are made out of the same building blocks. Demand comes mainly from two sources: independent mom-and-pop grocery stores which, unlike large retail chains, are two small to buy straight from producers, and food service operators that cater to consumers when they don't eat at home. Such food service operators range from snack machines to large institutional catering ventures, but most of these businesses are known in the trade as "horeca": hotels, restaurants, and cafes. Overall, Europe's wholesale market for food and drink is growing at the same sluggish pace as the retail market, but the figures, when added together, mask two opposing trends.
</summary>
<div class="text">
[E] 尽管有细节上的变化，被仔细审查过的各个国家（法国、德国、意大利和西班牙）的批发市场由相同的基本要素组成。需求主要来自于两个源头：独立的夫妻杂货店（不像大型零售连锁店，它们太小了而不能从生产商直接买）和迎合了不在家吃饭时的消费者的食品服务运营商。这样的食品服务运营商服务范围从零食贩卖机跨越至大型机构餐饮企业，但是大多数这些在行业内被称为“horeca”：旅馆、餐馆和咖啡馆。总的来说，后周的食品饮料批发市场以和零售市场一样的缓慢步伐在增长，但是这些数字当被加在一起时，就掩盖了相反的趋势。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
[F] For example, wholesale food and drink sales came to $268 billion in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom in 2000—more than 40 percent of retail sales. Moreover, average overall margins are higher in wholesale than in retail; wholesale demand from the food service sector is growing quickly as more Europeans eat out more often; and changes in the competitive dynamics of this fragmented industry are at last making it feasible for wholesalers to consolidate.
</summary>
<div class="text">
[F] 例如，在2000年的法国、德国、意大利、西班牙和英国，食物饮料批发销售额来到了2680亿，超过零售销售额40%。此外，批发平均整体利润比零售更高；随着更多的欧洲人更经常地外出吃饭，来自食品服务行业的批发需求正在快速增长；这个零碎的产业竞争动态的改变对于批发商来说最终会使得合并变得可行。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
[G] However, none of these requirements should deter large retailers (and even some large good producers and existing wholesalers) from trying their hand, for those that master the intricacies of wholesaling in Europe stand to reap considerable gains.
</summary>
<div class="text">
[G] 但是，这些需求都不应该阻止大型零售商（）去试试它们的身手，因为那些掌握了欧洲批发产业复杂情况的零售商很可能获得相当可观的收益。

A parallel situation exists in respect of predatory mammals and fish-eating birds. <u class="nospace">(48) Time was when biologists somewhat overworked the evidence that these creatures preserve the health of game by killing the physically weak, or that they prey only on "worthless" species.</u>Here again, the evidence had to be economic in order to be valid. It is only in recent years that we hear the more honest argument that predators are members of the community, and that no special interest has the right to exterminate them for the sake of benefit ,real or fancied, to itself.
