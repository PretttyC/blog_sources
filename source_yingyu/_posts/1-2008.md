The idea that some groups of people may be more intelligent than others is one of those hypotheses that dare not speak its name. But Gregory Cochran is <u>1</u> to say it anyway. He is that <u>2</u> bird, a scientist who works independently <u>3</u> any institution. He helped popularize the idea that some diseases not <u>4</u> thought to have a bacterial cause were actually infections, which aroused much controversy when it was first suggested.

<summary>
While still catching up to men in some spheres of modern life, women appear to be way ahead in at least one undesirable category. “Women are particularly susceptible to developing depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress compared to men,” according to Dr. Yehuda, chief psychiatrist at New York’s Veteran’s Administration Hospital.
</summary>
<div class="text">
尽管在一些现代生活的领域，女性仍然在追赶男性，但是至少在一个不受欢迎的类别中女性似乎非常领先。根据纽约老兵管理医院的首席精神病学家夜壶大医生，“相比于男性，在应对压力方面女性尤其容易受影响并产生抑郁症和焦虑症，”
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow affect the stress response, causing females under stress to produce more of the trigger chemicals than do males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when stressed-out female rats had their ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical responses became equal to those of the males.
</summary>
<div class="text">
对动物和人类的研究表示性激素会稍微影响压力反应，这会导致在同等条件下，处于压力下的雌性会产生比雄性更多的触发器化学物质。在一些研究中，当承受巨大压力的雌性老鼠移除他们的卵巢（雌性生殖器官）时，他们的化学反应变成和雄性同等水平。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Adding to a woman’s increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased “opportunities” for stress. “It’s not necessarily that women don’t cope as well. It’s just that they have so much more to cope with,” says Dr. Yehuda. “Their capacity for tolerating stress may even be greater than men’s,” she observes, “it’s just that they’re dealing with so many more things that they become worn out from it more visibly and sooner.”
</summary>
<div class="text">
对女性增加的压力化学物质剂量的加强，是产生压力“机会”的增加。“未必是女性不能同样的处理压力。仅仅是他们有更多的压力需要应对，”夜壶大医生说。“她们忍受压力的能力甚至可能比男性更要好，”她说到，“只是她们处理了如此多的事情以至于她们更快也更明显变得精疲力尽。”
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Dr. Yehuda notes another difference between the sexes. “I think that the kinds of things that women are exposed to tend to be in more of a chronic or repeated nature. Men go to war and are exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical violence. The kinds of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in domestic situations, by, unfortunately, parents or other family members, and they tend not to be one-shot deals. The wear-and-tear that comes from these longer relationships can be quite devastating.”
</summary>
<div class="text">
夜壶大医生主要到了另一个两性之间的不同。“我认为女性所遭受的种种事情往往有着长期的或重复的特质。男性参加战争，遭受战斗压力。男性遭受更多的是随机的身体暴力行为。女性遭受的各种人际关系暴力往往是在家庭环境中，不幸的是，这种暴力是父母或其他家庭成员造成的，并且往往不是一次性的。来自于这些长期关系的折磨可能是非常毁灭性的。”

<summary>
Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but was determined to finish college. “I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much frustration that that was my escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better.” Later, her marriage ended and she became a single mother. “It’s the hardest thing to take care of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the car payment, and pay the debt.I lived from paycheck to paycheck.”
</summary>
<div class="text">
艾德琳·阿尔瓦兹18岁结婚且生了一个儿子，但是决定去完成学业。“我非常努力去获得大学学位。我生活在如此多的挫折中，以至于去学校，提升自己和做的更好都成了我的逃避。”之后她的婚姻结束了，她变成了一个单亲妈妈。“最难的事情是照顾一个少年、有一个工作、支付租金、支付汽车账单和支付债务。我过着月光族的生活。”
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. But most women today are coping with a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain. Alvarez’s experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to diffuse stress before it threatens your health and your ability to function.
</summary>
<div class="text">
不是所有人都会经历这种阿尔瓦兹描述的严重的长期压力。但是如今的大多女性都承担着非常多的职责，很少休息,因此感到压力。阿尔瓦兹的经历证明在压力威胁你的健康和身体运转能力之前找到分散压力方法的重要性。

It used to be so straightforward. A team of researchers working together in the laboratory would submit the results of their research to a journal. A journal editor would then remove the author’s names and affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for review. Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper for publication or decline it. Copyright rested with the journal publisher, and researchers seeking knowledge of the results would have to subscribe to the journal.
</summary>
<div class="text">
它曾是如此直接。在实验室里一起工作的研究员团队提交他们的研究成果给期刊。然后期刊的编辑会从论文中移除作者的名字和所属单位并发给他们的同行来审查。依赖于收到的评论，编辑将接受论文发表或者拒绝它。版权归于期刊发行商，而探索知识成果的研究员将不得不订阅期刊。

No longer. The Internet——and pressure from funding agencies, who are questioning why commercial publishers are making money from government-funded research by restricting access to it——is making free access to scientific results a reality. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just issued a report describing the far-reaching consequences of this. The report, by John Houghton of Victoria University in Australia and Graham Vickery of the OECD, makes heavy reading for publishers who have, so far, made handsome profits. But it goes further than that. It signals a change in what has, until now, been a key element of scientific endeavor.
</summary>
<div class="text">
这种情况不再有了。互联网——和来自资助机构（这些机构质疑为什么商业出版社通过限制访问来从政府资助的研究中获利）的压力正使得自由访问科学成果成为现实。经济协作和发展组织刚刚发表了一个报告来描述这带来的深远的影响。这份报告，由澳大利亚的维多利亚大学的约翰·汉顿和OECD的格雷汗·维克力完成，让迄今为止赚取了丰厚的利润的出版商读起来心情沉重。但是它的影响比那更大。它象征着到现在位置作为科学尝试的关键因素的变化。
</div>

<details>
<summary>
The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research depends, in part, upon wide distribution and ready access. It is big business. In America, the core scientific publishing market is estimated at between $7 billion and $11 billion. The International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers says that there are more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specializing in these subjects. They publish more than 1.2 million articles each year in some 16,000 journals.
</summary>
<div class="text">
知识的价值和对研究的投资回报一定程度上取决于广泛的传播和易访问性。这是个大生意。在美国，核心科学出版市场估值在70亿美元和110亿美元之间。国际科学、技术和医疗出版商协会称由超过2000个世界各地的出版商专门从事于这些学科。他们每年在大约16000个期刊中出版超过120万篇文章。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 75% of scholarly journals are now online. Entirely new business models are emerging; three main ones were identified by the report’s authors. There is the so-called big deal, where institutional subscribers pay for access to a collection of online journal titles through site-licensing agreements. There is open-access publishing, typically supported by asking the author (or his employer) to pay for the paper to be published. Finally, there are open-access archives, where organizations such as universities or international laboratories support institutional repositories. Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such as delayed open-access, where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first six months, before making it freely available to everyone who wishes to see it. All this could change the traditional form of the peer-review process, at least for the publication of papers.
</summary>
<div class="text">
这正在发生变化。根据OECD报告，现在大约75%的学术期刊是在线的。崭新的商业模式浮现出来；三个主要的模式被报告作者所确定。有一种所谓的大订单模式，即机构的订阅者通过网络许可协议购买一系列在线期刊标题访问权。有开放访问的出版模式，一般通过要求作者(或他的雇主)支付出版论文的费用来支持。最后，还有开放访问存档模式，即如大学或国际实验室一样的组织支持机构仓库。这3种模式的混合的其他模式也存在，比如延迟开放访问，即在论文对想看它的所有人免费可获取之前，期刊只允许订阅者在前6个月阅读论文。所有这些会改变同行审查流程的传统形式，至少对于论文出版是这样。

In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of the only three players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last season, however, he would have been one of 42. The bodies playing major professional sports have changed dramatically over the years, and managers have been more than willing to adjust team uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, longer frames.

在1960年代早期，威尔特·张伯伦是在国家篮球协会中超过7英尺的仅有的3个运动员之一。但是，如果他在上个季度参加了，他将是42个人中的一个。几年来参与主要专业运动的运动员身体有了显著的变化，经理们也更加愿意调整队伍的制服来适应越来越多的更大更长的体格。

The trend in sports, though, may be obscuring an unrecognized reality: Americans have generally stopped growing. Though typically about two inches taller now than 140 years ago, today’s people—especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for many generations—apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s.And they aren’t likely to get any taller. “In the general population today, at this genetic, environmental level, we’ve pretty much gone as far as we can go,” says anthropologist William Cameron Chumlea of Wright State University. In the case of NBA players, their increase in height appears to result from the increasingly common practice of recruiting players from all over the world.

虽然体育界的趋势可能会掩盖这一未被被识别的现实：美国人普遍停止了生长。虽然比140年前的人高大约两英寸，但是如今的人们，尤其是出生在在美国生活了几代人的家庭的人，明显在1960年代早期到达了他们的极限。而他们不可能更高了。按如今的一般人口数量，“在现在的基因和环境水平下，我们已经达到了我们能到达的极限。“莱特州立大学的人类学家威廉姆·卡梅隆·查理说到。在NBA运动员的案例中，他们在身高上的增长似乎是由于对从世界各地招募来的运动员越来越多的普遍锻炼导致。

Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands calories and nutrients—notably, protein—to feed expanding tissues. At the start of the 20th century, under-nutrition and childhood infections got in the way. But as diet and health improved, children and adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about an inch and a half every 20 years, a pattern known as the secular trend in height. Yet according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, average height—5'9" for men, 5'4" for women—hasn’t really changed since 1960.

生长，很少能持续到超过20岁，需要热量和营养——尤其是蛋白质——来供养生长的组织。在20世纪初和儿童传染病阻碍了生长。但是随着饮食和健康的改善，儿童和青少年在身高上平均每20年增长1.5英寸，这种模式被称为身高的长期趋势。但是根据疾病控制和防止中心，男性平均身高5英尺9英寸和女性平均身高5英尺4英寸自1960年以后就没真正变化。

Genetically speaking, there are advantages to avoiding substantial height. During childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. Moreover, even though humans have been upright for millions of years, our feet and back continue to struggle with bipedal posture and cannot easily withstand repeated strain imposed by oversize limbs. “There are some real constraints that are set by the genetic architecture of the individual organism,” says anthropologist William Leonard of Northwestern University.

从基因角度来说，避免太高是有利的。在分娩时期，更大的宝宝更难通过产道。此外，尽管人类已经直立几千年，但是我们的脚和背一直在和两足动物的姿势作斗争，因而不能轻易的经受住过大的肢体施加的持续压力。"存在一些被个体组织的基因结构所设定的真正的限制。"东北大学的人类学家威廉姆·莱昂纳多。

Genetic maximums can change, but don’t expect this to happen soon. Claire C. Gordon, senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures that 90 percent of the uniforms and workstations fit recruits without alteration. She says that, unlike those for basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed for some time. And if you need to predict human height in the near future to design a piece of equipment, Gordon says that by and large, “you could use today's data and feel fairly confident.”

基因最大值可以改变，但是不要期待这会很快发生。克莱儿·C·戈登，马塞诸塞州，內蒂克的陆军研究中心的资深人类学家，确信百分之90的制服和工作站不用改动就适合新兵。她说，对于玩篮球的那些人，军队制服的长度已经有些时日没变了。如果你需要预测未来的人来高度以设计一套装备，戈登说到，大体上，“你可以使用今天的数据并且可以相当的自信。”

In 1784, five years before he became president of the United States, George Washington, 52, was nearly toothless. So he hired a dentist to transplant nine teeth into his jaw—having extracted them from the mouths of his slaves.
</summary>
<div class="text">
在1784年，他变成美国总统的5年前，52岁的乔治华盛顿几乎牙齿掉光了。所以他雇用一个牙科医生移植了9颗牙齿到他的下巴——是从他的奴隶们的嘴里提取的。

<summary>
That’s a far different image from the cherry-tree-chopping George most people remember from their history books. But recently, many historians have begun to focus on the role slavery played in the lives of the founding generation. They have been spurred in part by DNA evidence made available in 1998, which almost certainly proved Thomas Jefferson had fathered at least one child with his slave Sally Hemings. And only over the past 30 years have scholars examined history from the bottom up. Works of several historians reveal the moral compromises made by the nation’s early leaders and the fragile nature of the country’s infancy. More significant, they argue that many of the Founding Fathers knew slavery was wrong—and yet most did little to fight it.
</summary>
<div class="text">
那和大多数人从他们历史课本上记住的砍樱桃树的乔治是非常不同的印象。但是最近，许多历史学家开始聚焦于在创始人一代中奴隶制起的作用。他们一定程度上是被在1998年获得的DNA证据所激励，这几乎确定的证明了托马斯杰弗森和他的奴隶莎丽海明斯至少有一个孩子。仅仅在过去的30年里，学者们就将历史从头到尾检查了一遍。一些历史学家的工作揭露了国家早期领导人的道德妥协和国家初期虚弱的本质。更重要的是，他们认为许多开国元勋们知道奴隶制是错误的——但是几乎不去对抗它。
</div>

<summary>
More than anything, the historians say, the founders were hampered by the culture of their time. While Washington and Jefferson privately expressed distaste for slavery, they also understood that it was part of the political and economic bedrock of the country they helped to create.
</summary>
<div class="text">
历史学家表示，最重要的是，开国者们被他们时代的文化所限制。 尽管华盛顿和杰弗森私底下表达过对奴隶制的不满，但是他们也懂得它是他们帮助创建的国家的政治经济基石的一部分。

<summary>
For one thing, the South could not afford to part with its slaves. Owning slaves was “like having a large bank account,” says Wiencek, author of <i>An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America</i>. The southern states would not have signed the Constitution without protections for the “peculiar institution,” including a clause that counted a slave as three fifths of a man for purposes of congressional representation.
</summary>
<div class="text">
首先，南方不能承受舍弃它们的奴隶。拥有奴隶“就像有一个大银行账户”，《一个不完美的上帝：乔治华盛顿，他的奴隶们和美国的创立》的作者文赛克说到。在没有对“特殊制度”的保护的情况下，南方的州不会签署宪法，制度中包括一个条款，它以国会代表为目的将一个奴隶当成五分之三个人来计算。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
And the statesmen’s political lives depended on slavery. The three-fifths formula handed Jefferson his narrow victory in the presidential election of 1800 by inflating the votes of the southern states in the Electoral College. Once in office, Jefferson extended slavery with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803; the new land was carved into 13 states, including three slave states.
</summary>
<div class="text">
而政治家的政治生涯取决于奴隶制。这个五分之三公式通过猛增在选举团中南部州的选票使得杰弗森在1800人的总统选举中险胜。一旦就任，杰弗森在1803年里用路易斯安那购买案扩大了奴隶制；新的陆地被分为13个州，其中包括3个奴隶州。

<summary>
Still, Jefferson freed Hemings’s children—though not Hemings herself or his approximately 150 other slaves. Washington, who had begun to believe that <i>all</i> men were created equal after observing the bravary of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary War, overcame the strong opposition of his relatives to grant his slaves their freedom in his will. Only a decade earlier, such an act would have required legislative approval in Virginia.

即便如此，杰弗森释放海明斯的孩子们——尽管没有释放海明斯本人或他的大约150个其他奴隶们。在观察到独立战争时期黑人士兵的勇敢后而开始相信人人生而平等的华盛顿，克服了他的亲属们的强烈反对在他的遗嘱中授予他的奴隶们自由。仅仅十年前，在弗吉利亚州这样的行为还要求立法机构批准。

Awkward or wordy phrasing or unclear sentences and paragraphs should be mercilessly poked and prodded into shape.

<summary>
In his autobiography，Darwin himself speaks of his intellectual powers with extraordinary modesty. He points out that he always experienced much difficulty in expressing himself clearly and concisely, but <u class="nospace">(46)he believes that this very difficulty may have had the compensating advantage of forcing him to think long and intently about every sentence, and thus enabling him to detect errors in reasoning and in his own observations.</u> He disclaimed the possession of any great quickness of apprehension or wit, such as distinguished Huxley. <u class="nospace">(47) He asserted, also, that his power to follow a long and purely abstract train of thought was very limited, for which reason he felt certain that he never could have succeeded with mathematics.</u> His memory, too, he described as extensive, but hazy. So poor in one sense was it that he never could remember for more than a few days a single date or a line of poetry. <u class="nospace">(48) On the other hand, he did not accept as well founded the charge made by some of his critics that, while he was a good observer, he had no power of reasoning.</u> This, he thought, could not be true, because the “Origin of Species” is one long argument from the beginning to the end, and has convinced many able men. No one, he submits, could have written it without possessing some power of reasoning. He was willing to assert that “I have a fair share of invention, and of common sense or judgment, such as every fairly successful lawyer or doctor must have, but not, I believe, in any higher degree.” <u class="nospace">(49)He adds humbly that perhaps he was “superior to the common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and in observing them carefully.”</u>
</summary>
<div class="text">
在达尔文的自传里，他非常谦虚地谈到了他的智力。他指出他总是在清晰简明的表达自己方面经历很多困难，<u class="nospace">(46)但是他相信正是这些困难可能又补偿性的优点，即强迫他长时间专心地思考每个句子，进而使他能够在推理和他自己的观察中察觉到错误。</u>他否认拥有任何绝好的快速理解能力或智力，如杰出的哈克斯勒。<u class="nospace">(47)他也声称他进行长时间纯粹抽象思考的能力时非常有限的，因为这他确定他绝不会在数学方面能成功。</u>他也描述他的记忆为广泛但是模糊的。某种意义上是贫乏的，以至于他不能记住一个单一的日期或诗歌的一行超过几天。<u class="nospace">(48)另一方面，他不接受一些批评家的指控是有根据的，这些指控是尽管他是一个好的观察者，但他没有推理能力。</u>他认为，这可能不对，因为《物种起源》从头到尾是一个长篇论证，且说服了很多有才能的人。他认为，没有人可以在没有一些推理能力的情况下写出它来。他愿意宣称，“我有一定的创造力，常识或判断力，像每一个相当成功的律师或医生有的一样，但是我相信没有比他们更高的程度。”<u class="nospace">(49)他谦虚地补充到，他“也许在注意容易被忽略的事情和仔细观察方面优于普通人。”</u>

<summary>
Writing in the last year of his life, he expressed the opinion that in two or three respects his mind had changed during the preceding twenty or thirty years. Up to the age of thirty or beyond it poetry of many kinds gave him great pleasure. Formerly, too, pictures had given him considerable, and music very great, delight. In 1881, however, he said: “Now for many years I cannot endure to read a line of poetry. I have also almost lost my taste for pictures or music.” <u class="nospace">(50) Darwin was convinced that the loss of these tastes was not only a loss of happiness, but might possibly be injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral character.</u>
</summary>
<div class="text">
在他生命的最后一年里，他在写作中表达了一个观点，在过去的二三十年期间他的思想在两三个方面发生了改变。直到30多岁时，各种各样的诗歌给了他很大的愉悦。之前，图画也给了他相当多的快乐，音乐更是让他体验巨大的喜悦。但是在1881年，他说到：“如今我不能持续阅读一行诗歌许多年了。我几乎已经失去了我对图画和音乐的品味。”<u class="nospace">(50)达尔文确信这些品味的丢失不仅是幸福的丢失，还可能是对智力的伤害，更有可能是对道德品质的损害。</u>
