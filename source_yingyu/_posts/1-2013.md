People are, on the whole, poor at considering background information when making individual decisions. At first glance this might seem like a strength that grants the ability to make judgments which are unbiased by external factors. But Dr. Uri Simonsohn speculated that an inability to consider the big picture was leading decision-makers to be biased by the daily samples of information they were working with. For example, he theorised that a judge fearful of appearing too soft on crime might be more likely to send someone to prison if he had already sentenced five or six other defendants only to forced community service on that day.

总体上，人们在做个人决定时并不擅长于考虑背景信息。乍一看，这似乎是一种优势，它授予通过不受外在因素偏见影响而做出判断的能力。但是Uri Simonsohn医生推测到，没能力考虑大的情景正在导致决策人被每天接触的信息样本所影响而有偏见。比如，他提出理论，一个害怕表现出对罪犯软弱的法官，如果他已经在那天判决了5或6个被告人只是去强制社区服务，那么他也许更有可能将其他人送往监狱。

Dr. Simonsohn found if the score of the previous candidate in a daily series of interviewees was 0.75 points or more higher than that of the one <u>17</u> that, then the score for the next applicant would <u>18</u> by an average of 0.075 points.

Dr. Simonsohn found if the score of the previous candidate in a daily series of interviewees was 0.75 points or more higher than that of the one before that, then the score for the next applicant would drop by an average of 0.075 points.

<div class="text">
Simonsohn发现，在每天的一系列面试者中，如果前面候选人的分数比他前面的人高出0.75分或者更多，那么下一个申请人的分数平均下降0.075分。这可能听起来很小，但是要撤销掉这样一个下降的效果需要比原本必需GMAT分数高出30多的分数。

<summary>
In the 2006 film version of <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>, Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep, scolds her unattractive assistant for imagining that high fashion doesn’t affect her. Priestly explains how the deep blue color of the assistant’s sweater descended over the years from fashion shows to department stores and to the bargain bin in which the poor girl doubtless found her garment.
</summary>
<div class="text">
在2006年的《The Devil Wears Prada》电影版中，Meryl Streep扮演的Miranda Priestly责骂她那没有吸引力的助理，因为她认为高端时尚影响不了她。Priestly解释了该助理毛衣的深蓝色多年以来是如何从装秀降至百货商店再到减价商品区的，毫无疑问这个可怜的女孩儿在其中找到了她的衣服。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
This top-down conception of the fashion business couldn’t be more out of date or at odds with the feverish world described in <i>Overdressed</i>, Elizabeth Cline’s three-year indictment of “fast fashion”. In the last decade or so, advances in technology have allowed mass-market labels such as Zara, H&M, and Uniqlo to react to trends more quickly and anticipate demand more precisely. Quicker turnarounds mean less wasted inventory, more frequent releases, and more profit. These labels encourage style-conscious consumers to see clothes as disposable—meant to last only a wash or two, although they don’t advertise that—and to renew their wardrobe every few weeks. By offering on-trend items at dirt-cheap prices, Cline argues, these brands have hijacked fashion cycles, shaking an industry long accustomed to a seasonal pace.
</summary>
<div class="text">
时尚行业的这种自上而下的观念不能更过时了或者并不符合《过分打扮》中描述的狂热的世界，这本书是Elizabeth Cline对“快时尚”三年的控诉。在过去的大约10年中，科技的进步使如Zara、H&M和Uniqlo一样的大众市场品牌能够更快地对潮流做出反应并更准确地预测需求。更快的周转意味着更少的浪费库存、更频繁的发布和更多的收益。这些品牌鼓励有时尚意识的消费者将衣服看作是一次性的（意味着只持续洗一或两次，尽管他们并不宣传那样），今儿每几周更新一次他们的衣柜。Cline认为，这些品牌通过以超便宜的价格提供流行的物品劫持了时尚周期，动摇了长期习惯于季节性步伐的产业。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The victims of this revolution, of course, are not limited to designers. For H&M to offer a $5.95 knit miniskirt in all its 2,300-plus stores around the world, it must rely on low-wage overseas labor, order in volumes that strain natural resources, and use massive amounts of harmful chemicals.
</summary>
<div class="text">
当然，这场变革的受害者并不局限于设计师。由于H&M要在它世界各地2300多个商店里提供5.95美元的编织超短裙，它必须依赖低工资的海外劳工、过度消耗自然资源的大量订单，并使用大量的有害化学物质。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<i>Overdressed</i> is the fashion world’s answer to consumer-activist bestsellers like Michael Pollan’s <i>The Omnivore’s Dilemma</i>. “Mass-produced clothing, like fast food, fills a hunger and need, yet is non-durable and wasteful,” Cline argues. Americans, she finds, buy roughly 20 billion garments a year—about 64 items per person—and no matter how much they give away, this excess leads to waste.
</summary>
<div class="text">
《过度穿着》是时尚界对像Michael Pollan的《杂食者的困境》一样的消费活跃分子畅销书的回应。Cline认为，“大批量生产的衣服，就像快餐一样，满足饥饿和需求，但是不可持续且浪费。”她发现，美国人一年购买大约200亿的衣服（一个人大约64个物品）,而且无论他们怎么赠送，这种过剩都将导致浪费。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Towards the end of <i>Overdressed</i>, Cline introduced her ideal, a Brooklyn woman named Sarah Kate Beaumont, who since 2008 has made all of her own clothes—and beautifully. But as Cline is the first to note, it took Beaumont decades to perfect her craft; her example can’t be knocked off.
</summary>
<div class="text">
在《过度着装》的结尾，Cline介绍了她的典范，一个名为Sarah Kate Beaumont的Brooklyn女性，她自2008年后制作了她自己的所有衣服并且做的很漂亮。但是正如Cline一开始注意到的，完善她的手艺话费了Beaumont数十年的时间；她的例子不会被复制。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Though several fast-fashion companies have made efforts to curb their impact on labor and the environment—including H&M, with its green Conscious Collection line—Cline believes lasting change can only be effected by the customer. She exhibits the idealism common to many advocates of sustainability, be it in food or in energy. Vanity is a constant; people will only start shopping more sustainably when they can’t afford not to.
</summary>
<div class="text">
尽管一些快时尚公司已经努力去抑制对劳工和环境的影响——包括H&M和它的绿色意识系列产品线——Cline相信持续的变化只能由顾客来影响。无论是在食品还是能源方面，她都展现了许多可持续发展提倡者共有的理想主义。虚荣心使不变的；人们将只会在他们不能承受不可持续购买时才会开始更加可持续地购买。

An old saying has it that half of all advertising budgets are wasted—the trouble is, no one knows which half. In the internet age, at least in theory, this fraction can be much reduced. By watching what people search for, click on and say online, companies can aim “behavioral” ads at those most likely to buy.
</summary>
<div class="text">
有一句老话是，广告预算的一半都是浪费的——麻烦的是，没人知道是哪一半。在互联网时代，至少在理论上，这部分可以大幅度减少。通过观察人们在线上搜索的、点击的和说的内容，公司可以使“行为”广告的目标定为最有可能购买的那些人。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
In the past couple of weeks a quarrel has illustrated the value to advertisers of such fine-grained information: Should advertisers assume that people are happy to be tracked and sent behavioral ads? Or should they have explicit permission?
</summary>
<div class="text">
在过去的几周里，一场争论表明了这样的细粒度信息对广告商的价值：广告上应该假设人们是乐于被追踪和被投送行为广告的吗？活着他们应该有明确的允许吗？
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
In December 2010 America’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) proposed adding a “do not track” (DNT) option to internet browsers, so that users could tell advertisers that they did not want to be followed. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Apple’s Safari both offer DNT; Google’s Chrome is due to do so this year. In February the FTC and Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) agreed that the industry would get cracking on responding to DNT requests.
</summary>
<div class="text">
在2010年12月，美国联邦贸易委员会（FTC）提议增加一个“不追踪”（DNT）选项到互联网浏览器，这样用户可以告诉广告商他们不想被跟踪。微软的IE和苹果Safari都提供了DNT；谷歌的Chrome预期在今天也要提供。在2月份FTC和数字广告联盟（DAA）达成一致，这个行业将开始行动来回应DNT的要求。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
On May 31st Microsoft set off the row: It said that InternetExplorer 10, the version due to appear Windows 8, would have DNT as a default.
</summary>
<div class="text">
在5月31号，微软引起了争端：它表示IE10（和Windows 8一起出现的版本）将默认使用DNT。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Advertisers are horrified. Human nature being what it is, most people stick with default settings. Few switch DNT on now, but if tracking is off it will stay off. Bob Liodice, the chief executive of the Association of National Advertisers, says consumers will be worse off if the industry cannot collect information about their preferences. People will not get fewer ads, he says, “they’ll get less meaningful, less targeted ads.”
</summary>
<div class="text">
广告商们很惊恐。人性就是这样，大多数人坚持使用默认设置。现在很少有人打开DNT，但是如果追踪是关闭的它也将保持关闭。国家广告商协会的首席执行官Bob Liodice声称，如果这个行业不能收集关于消费者偏好的信息，消费者们将变得更糟。他表示，人们不会获得更少的广告，“它们将变成更没有意义，更没有目标性的广告。”
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
It is not yet clear how advertisers will respond. Getting a DNT signal does not oblige anyone to stop tracking, although some companies have promised to do so. Unable to tell whether someone really objects to behavioral ads or whether they are sticking with Microsoft’s default, some may ignore a DNT signal and press on anyway.
</summary>
<div class="text">
还不清楚广告商们会如何回应。获得一个DNT标志并不强制任何人停止跟踪，尽管一些公司承诺过要这样做。不能分辨出某个人使真的反对行为广告还是只是坚持使用微软的默认设置，所以无论如何一些公司都可能会忽略DNT标志而继续进行追踪。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Also unclear is why Microsoft has gone it alone. After all, it has an ad business too, which it says will comply with DNT requests, though it is still working out how. If it is trying to upset Google, which relies almost wholly on advertising, it has chosen an indirect method: There is no guarantee that DNT by default will become the norm. DNT does not seem an obviously huge selling point for Windows 8—though the firm has compared some of its other products favorably with Google’s on that count before. Brendon Lynch, Microsoft’s chief privacy officer, blogged: “we believe consumers should have more control.” Could it really be that simple?
</summary>
<div class="text">
同样不清楚的是为什么唯独微软实现了它。毕竟它也有广告业务，它声称广告业务会遵守DNT要求，尽管它仍然在拟定该如何遵守。如果它试图使Google感到不安，而Google几乎完全依赖于广告，那么它选择了一种间接的的方法：不能保证默认的DNT会变成规范。对Windows 8来说，DNT似乎不是一个明显的大卖点——尽管该公司之前已经在数量上有利地比较了它和Google的一些其他产品。微软首席隐私官Brendon Lynch，博客中写到：“我们相信消费者本应该有更多的控制权。”它真的能变得那样简单吗？

Now utopia has grown unfashionable, as we have gained a deeper appreciation of the range of threats facing us, from asteroid strike to epidemic flu to climate change. You might even be tempted to assume that humanity has little future to look forward to.

But such gloominess is misplaced. The fossil record shows that many species have endured for millions of years—so why shouldn’t we? Take a broader look at our species’ place in the universe, and it becomes clear that we have an excellent chance of surviving for tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years. Look up <i>Homo sapiens</i> in the “Red List” of threatened species of the international Union for the  Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and you will read: “Listed as Least Concern as the species is very widely distributed, adaptable, currently increasing, and there are no major threats resulting in an overall population decline.”

但是这种沮丧是被错放的。化石记录展示了许多物种已经持续了几千年——所以为什么我们不可以？以更广阔的视野看待我们物种在宇宙中的位置，这将变得清晰起来，我们有一个极好的生存机会，即使不能数十万年也有几十万年。查阅在自然保护国际联合会的威胁物种“红色列表”中的“智人”，你将读到：“被列为无危物种是由于该物种广泛分布、适应性强、数量正在增加，且没有主要威胁会导致总体的数量下降。”

Perhaps willfully, it may be easier to think about such lengthy timescales than about the more immediate future. The potential evolution of today’s technology, and its social consequences, is dazzlingly complicated, and it’s perhaps best left to science-fiction writers and futurologists to explore the many possibilities we can envisage. That’s one reason why we have launched <i>Arc</i>, a new publication dedicated to the near future.

But take a longer view and there is a surprising amount that we can say with considerable assurance.

On a five to three vote, the Supreme Court knocked out much of Arizona’s immigration law Monday—a modest policy victory for the Obama Administration. But on the more important matter of the Constitution, the decision was an 8-0 defeat for the Administration’s effort to upset the balance of power between the federal government and the states.
</summary>
<div class="text">
以5比3的投票，最高法院在周一淘汰了大部分Arizona州的移民法案——对奥巴马政府来说这是一个轻微的政策胜利。但是关于更重要的宪法问题，对于该政府推翻联邦政府和州政府之间的权利平衡的努力，该决定是一个8比0的败北。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
In <i>Arizona v. United States</i>, the majority overturned three of the four contested provisions of Arizona’s controversial plan to have state and local police enforce federal immigration law. The Constitutional principles that Washington alone has the power to “establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization” and that federal laws precede state laws are noncontroversial. Arizona had attempted to fashion state policies that ran parallel to the existing federal ones.
</summary>
<div class="text">
在“Arizona州对美国”案中，多数人推翻了Arizona计划四个有争议条款中的三个，该计划备受争议，想要使州政府和当地警察执行联邦移民法。只有华盛顿州有权利“确立一个统一的入籍规则”和联邦法律优先于州法律的宪法原则是没有争议的。Arizona州已经试图制定并行于现存联邦政策的州政策。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and the Court’s liberals, ruled that the state flew too close to the federal sun. On the overturned provisions the majority held that Congress had deliberately “occupied the field” and Arizona has thus intruded on the federal’s privileged powers.
</summary>
<div class="text">
Anthony Kennedy大法官，和首席大法官John Roberts以及法院的自由派们，裁定该州离联邦权力太近了。关于被推翻的条款，大多人认为，国会故意“占领了该领域”，因此Arizona侵犯了联邦政府的特权。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
However, the Justices said that Arizona police would be allowed to verify the legal status of people who come in contact with law enforcement. That’s because Congress has always envisioned joint federal-state immigration enforcement and explicitly encourages state officers to share information and cooperate with federal colleagues.
</summary>
<div class="text">
但是，该法官说，Arizona州的警察将被允许核查与执法部门接触的人的合法身份。那是因为国会总是在设想共同的联邦-州移民法的实施，并且明确地鼓励州官员和联邦同事分享信息和合作。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Two of the three objecting Justices—Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas—agreed with this Constitutional logic but disagreed about which Arizona rules conflicted with the federal statute. The only major objection came from Justice Antonin Scalia, who offered an even more robust defense of state privileges going back to the Alien and Sedition Acts.
</summary>
<div class="text">
三个反对的法官中的两个（Justices—Samuel Alito 和 Clarence Thomas）赞成这个宪法逻辑，但是不同意哪些Arizona州的规则与联邦法规冲突这种问题的逻辑。唯一主要的反对来自于大法官Antonin Scalia，他给州特权提供了更加强硬的辩护，这种特权可以追溯到《外国人和煽动言论法案》。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The 8-0 objection to President Obama turns on what Justice Samuel Alito describes in his objection as “a shocking assertion of federal executive power”. The White House argued that Arizona’s laws conflicted with its enforcement priorities, even if state laws complied with federal statutes to the letter. In effect, the White House claimed that it could invalidate any otherwise legitimate state law that it disagrees with.
</summary>
<div class="text">
对奥巴马总统的8比0反对转向了Samuel Alito法官在他反对中所描述的“一个令人震惊的联邦执行权主张”。白宫认为，即使州法律彻底地符合联邦法规，Arizona州的法律也与白宫的执行权冲突。实际上，白宫声称它可以废除任何其他它不赞成的合法州法律。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Some powers do belong exclusively to the federal government, and control of citizenship and the borders is among them. But if Congress wanted to prevent states from using their own resources to check immigration status, it could. It never did so. The Administration was in essence asserting that because it didn’t want to carry out Congress’s immigration wishes, no state should be allowed to do so either. Every Justice rightly rejected this remarkable claim.
</summary>
<div class="text">
一些权利确实专属于联邦政府，公民身份和边界的控制就属于它们。但是如果国会想要阻止州使用它们自己的资源去检查移民身份，它是可以的。它从没这样做过。政府本质上是在宣称，由于它不想实施国会的移民意图，所以不应该有州被允许也去做这样的事。每个大法官公正地拒绝了这个不同寻常的主张。

The trick is to direct these funds better. The European Union Framework funding programs have long had a category specifically targeted at social scientists.

It is speculated that gardens arise from a basic human need in the individuals who made them: the need for creative expression. There is no doubt that gardens evidence an irrepressible urge to create, express, fashion, and beautify and that self-expression is a basic human urge; <u class="nospace">(46) yet when one looks at the photographs of the garden created by the homeless,it strikes one that , for all their diversity of styles, these gardens speak of various other fundamental urges, beyond that of decoration and creative expression.</u>
</summary>
<div class="text">
据推测，花园的出现是来自于创造它们的个人的基本人类需求：创造性表达的需求。毫无疑问，花园证明存在一种难以抑制的创造的、表达的、塑造和美化的冲动，并且自我表达是一种基本的人类欲望；<u class="nospace">(46) 但是当一个人看到被无家可归的人创造的花园照片时，它使人意识到，尽管它们有各种各种的类型，但是这些花园体现了不同的其它基本诉求，这超出了装饰和创造性表达的诉求。</u>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
One of these urges has to do with creating a state of peace in the midst of turbulence, a “still point of the turning world,” to borrow a phrase from T. S. Eliot. <u class="nospace">(47) A sacred place of peace, however crude it may be, is a distinctly human need, as opposed to shelter, which is a distinctly animal need.</u> This distinction is so much so that where the latter is lacking, as it is for these unlikely gardens, the former becomes all the more urgent. Composure is a state of mind made possible by the structuring of one’s relation to one’s environment. <u class="nospace">(48) The gardens of the homeless, which are in effect homeless gardens, introduce form into an urban environment where it either didn’t exist or was not discernible as such.</u> In so doing they give composure to a segment of the inarticulate environment in which they take their stand.
</summary>
<div class="text">
这些诉求中的一种是必须和在动荡中创造和平状态有关，借用T. S. Eliot的话就是一个“转变世界的静止点”。<u class="nospace">(47)一个神圣的和平地区，无论它有多原始，显然都是人类的需求，而庇护所相反，它显然是动物的需求。</u> 这个区别是如此大以至于当后者缺乏时，就像这些不太可能拥有后者的园丁一样，前者变得更加的紧迫。沉着冷静是一种心态，通过构建人与环境的关系使其成为可能。<u class="nospace">(48) 无家可归之人的花园，实际上是无家可归的花园，将形式进入都市环境，在这种环境中，要么这种形式没有存在过要么这种形式没有被当作形式看待过。 </u> 这样一来，他们将平静给予了他们所立足的那片难以言喻的环境。
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Another urge or need that these gardens appear to respond to, or to arise from, is so intrinsic that we are barely ever conscious of its abiding claims on us. When we are deprived of green, of plants, of trees, <u class="nospace">(49) most of us give in to a demoralization of spirit which we usually blame on some psychological conditions, until one day we find ourselves in a garden and feel the oppression vanish as if by magic.</u> In most of the homeless gardens of New York City the actual cultivation of plants is unfeasible, yet even so the compositions often seem to represent attempts to call forth the spirit of plant and animal life, if only symbolically, through a clumplike arrangement of materials, an introduction of colors, small pools of water, and a frequent presence of petals or leaves as well as of stuffed animals. On display here are various fantasy elements whose reference, at some basic level, seems to be the natural world. <u class="nospace">(50) It is this implicit or explicit reference to nature that fully justifies the use of the word garden, though in a “liberated” sense, to describe these synthetic constructions.</u> In them we can see biophilia—a yearning for contact with nonhuman life—assuming uncanny representational forms.
</summary>
<div class="text">
这些花园似乎反映着或者源自的另一种欲望或需求，是如此的根深蒂固以至于我们几乎从没意识到它对我们的持久的要求。当我们被剥夺了绿地、植物和树木时，<u class="nospace">(49)我们大多数会屈服于精神上的颓废，我们通常以心理的方式去责备这种精神颓废，直到有一天我们发现我们自己置身花园中才感觉到这种沮丧好像魔法般地消失了。</u>在大多数无家可归的纽约市花园中，实际的植物培养是不可行的，但是尽管如此，这些花园也似乎通常体现了对唤起动植物生命精神的尝试，哪怕是象征性的也好，方式是通过对材料的簇从式安排，对颜色和小水池的引进和对花瓣或树叶和毛绒玩具的频繁展现。这里呈现的是各种各样的奇幻元素，在某种基本的层面上，这些元素的参照看起来就像是自然界。<u class="nospace">(50)尽管是以“开放的”理解方式，但正是这个含蓄或明确的对自然的参考，完全证明了对使用单词“花园”来描述这些人工合成建造的合理性，</u>在他们之中，我们可以看见热爱生命的天性——一种对接触非人类生活的渴望——这种天性呈现出不可思议的表现形式。
